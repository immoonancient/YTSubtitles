00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,880
# 保证大家都回去做去
I am sure everyone wants to give a shot at home

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,960
# 炖银耳汽锅鸡的这种鸡最好用雏母鸡
It’s the best to cook with pullet

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,280
# 没下过蛋的母鸡
Hen that has never laid any egg before

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,400
# 这是一个宫廷黄鸡
This is an “Royal Chick”

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,680

# 从脊背开一刀 然后两个腿分开
Open up the back with knife and pull the chicken legs apart

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,520

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,640
# 也就是我们说的翅根儿
Which is what we called “Chicken Drumette”

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,760
# 刀进去 刀尖正好窝到这个窝里头
Insert the tip of knife inside and make sure the tip is right inside the notch

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,720
# 拿手一硌 按着 往下一拽就行了
Press and push the knife and you can pull off the wing easily

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,080

# 往下一别 拿刀尖你看着啊
Pull it down. Take a look. We’ll use the tip of knife

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,680
# 大妈给照细着点

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
# 因为这有一根筋 拿刀
Because there is a tendon, use knife

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,720

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,040
# 剌一刀 硌着 拿刀尖一扥 下来了

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,600
# 这就是那里脊

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
# 走 两根儿 这鸡架子就没用了
There we go. Two pieces. We don’t need the skeleton anymore

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
# 鸡架子要多的话我们可以熬汤
We can make chicken broth if we have extra skeleton

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,840
# 这个就没用了 浪费啦
Are we gonna throw it? What a waste!

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,160
# 浪费不了 熬汤啊
No, we can make broth

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,560
# 你看鸡牙子里头 筋
You see the fillet has a lot of tendons

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,280
# 拿手指头摁住了 使劲就下来了 一推
Hold it with your fingers.  Press and push it

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,600
# 下面开始剔 怎么剔 就三下两下的

# 翅根 给一刀
At the bottom end of wing drumette. Cut through

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,280

# 你看一顶
Easily push it out

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,640

# 你看翅中这儿 这点轻轻给一刀
Look at the wing flat. Knock it slightly

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,760

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,280
# 拿刀一别 拿刀尖 这刀尖很有用
Push it outward with your knife and then use the knife tip. The tip of knife is pretty useful.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,320

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,840
# 干净不干净
So clean, right?

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,840
# 一点肉都没有 还真是干干净净的
No more meat left. That’s amazing.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,640
# 翅尖就不用了 这都去熬汤了
We don’t need the wing tip. All go into the soup

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,560
# 这鸡胸肉剔完了
We are done with the chicken breast

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,840
# 鸡腿肉 因为这只鸡来的时候是盘着的
Chicken legs. Since the chicken was folded when we got it,

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,360
# 这只关节上有点断了
the joint was kind of broken

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,880

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,360
# 鸡腿肉弄好了 按着这骨节儿
Flat the chicken leg. Hold the ankle.

53

# 刀
Use the knife

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,200

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,200
# 这骨头全露出来了 这有个关节
Here comes out the bone. There is a joint

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,920

# 一别 太费劲了
Push. That’s too hard.

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,960
# 剔这只鸡用多长时间
How long will it take to cut the whole chicken?

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,200
# 那时候我们搞比赛的时候
When I was in a competition,

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,160
# 对你们那时候比赛过
I remember that you’ve participated one before

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,880

Within only 55 seconds

63
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,560
# 所有的骨头就都离开了
All bones are off

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
# 咱们今天因为给网友展示
Because we need to show to our youtube users

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,520
# 速度稍微慢一点 让网友看清楚一点
We have to do it slower to make sure it’s clear enough to follow

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
# 实在看不清怎么办 就买去就行了
What if it’s not clear enough? Just go out and buy one

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,960
# 这有根牙签骨 紧贴着 很细
Here is a Fibula. Attached. Thin

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,120
# 这叫牙签骨 拿刀压住了这骨头
It’s called “fibula”. Hold the bones with knife

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,600
# 也是给它扥下来
Pull it out

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,160
# 这是它的关节骨头 它不是肉
This is bone not meat

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,200
# 牙签骨在这儿呢
This is the fibula

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
# 看见了很细
So thin

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,840
# 整个的鸡就剔完了
So we are all done with the whole chicken

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,400
# 剔完了我们要检查有些小的
We need to do a final check

77
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,600
# 可能还有些小骨头 摸一摸
There might be some small pieces of bones

78
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,960
# 切干净 都干净了
All should be cleaned out

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,080
# 银耳汽锅鸡咱们给它改改刀啊
Let’s trim the chicken

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,240
# 排排刀 这叫排 排刀
Scoring. This is called “scoring”

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,400
# 腿儿上筋多 刀尖硌一下
Chicken legs have more fasciae. Use knife tip to break it

82
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,480
# 筋再给它斩一斩
Break the fasciae

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
# 鸡胸肉也是
So does the chicken breast

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
# 摸摸这地方有小骨头没有
Feel if there are small pieces of bones

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
# 你看这 有
There is

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
# 给它去了
Trim it off

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,320

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,720
# 排排刀等于一会儿一传热
Scoring it

91
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
# 跟小球似的
It will form like a ball once it’s heated

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,120
# 鸡肉没有切的 全是剁
We don’t “cut” chicken we “chop” it

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,280
# 因为它切着有筋 不好切 这叫鸡块
The fasciae make it hard to cut. This is called chicken nuggets

94
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,040

95
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,760
# 搁一盆里
Put all in one bowl

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,800
# 黄酒
Huangjiu (rice wine)

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,160
# 盐 还是那句话 咱家盐不咸
Salt. The salt I’m using is not that salty.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,880
# 多搁点 两勺
So more. Two tablespoons

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,400
# 淀粉 淀粉有玉米淀粉
Starch. Corn starch

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,760
# 咱家这个就是玉米淀粉
We’re using corn starch

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,960
# 有白薯粉 有土豆粉 有绿豆淀粉
There are sweet potato starch, potato starch and green bean starch.

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,720
# 这个淀粉用哪个最好
Which is the best?

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
# 就是玉米淀粉 绿豆淀粉
Corn starch or mung bean starch

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
# 像有的生粉（不适合） 太黏了
Some, like potato starch, are not good for it. Too sticky

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,520
# 蛋清 一个鸡蛋的蛋清 用不了
Egg white of one egg. No need to use all.

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,400
# 所以有时候我们有好多网友炒菜
So sometimes when we make stir fries

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,640
# 说怎么老粘锅 不是锅的问题
People are asking why food always stick to the pan. It’s not because of the pan

108
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,920
# 是料不够 不是 料多了 蛋清太多
It’s not because of the lack of ingredients.  It’s because we have too many ingredients. Too much egg white.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,600

110
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
# 我们给它上浆
Tenderize the meat with starch and egg white

111
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
# 前些日子介绍过水滑 油滑
We have introduced “cook in water” and “cook in oil” in our previous video

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,760
# 因为咱们是炖汤 就要水滑
We need to “cook in water” this time because we are making soup

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,040
# 炖汤 不要那么多油
You do not want too much oil when you make soup

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,680
# 这个出来以后特别清淡
This way your soup will be fresh and light

115
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,320
# 浆的是以什么为标准 一个是上劲了
How to know that the meat is well-tenderized. Tip 1 is that you can feel the drag when you sir it

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,720
# 黏糊了 也说明这淀粉全覆在肉上了
Number two, it looks sticky which means the meat is all covered by starch

117
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
# 水滑的时候
When we cook meat in water

118
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,720
# 这淀粉略微的要比炒菜的淀粉
We need a little bit more starch than we use for stir fries

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
# 略微的多一点
A little bit more

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,040
# 因为它在水里它要分解一部分
This is because it will dissolve some into water

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,440
# 这个不用拿油封 炒菜可以拿油封上
Don’t need to add oil in. If you want to make stir fries you can add some oil.

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,800
# （用油封）下锅容易散（不易粘连）
Meat can fall apart easily (not stick together) in the pot with oil

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
# 这个就不用了是吧
We don’t use oil this time

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,000
# 忘了 白胡椒
I forgot! Add white pepper powder

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
# 这银耳我们有的人爱吃冰糖银耳
Some people like eating white wood mushroom with white rock sugar

127
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,960
# 冰糖银耳别老早放冰糖
Don’t put sugar too early

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,040
# 白糖冰糖都不能早放 后放
No matter what sugar it is

129
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,240
# 先把银耳蒸烂 然后再放冰糖再蒸
Get the white wood mushroom cooked first. Then add sugar and steam again.

130
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
# 那银耳蒸出来以后软糯滑
This way the white wood mushroom will be super smooth

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,600
# 我们在涨发干货的时候 不要用热水
Do not use hot water to re-hydrate dried food

132
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,480
# 太急 你说木耳银耳 就凉水早点泡
Don’t rush. You can start earlier with cold water

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,880
# 提前两三个小时给它泡上
Re-hydrate it two or three hours in advance

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
# 这干货的东西
For dried food

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,840
# 一定要用凉水让它慢慢回软
You have to use cold water to re-hydrate it slowly

136
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
# 咱们等锅的功夫
While we are waiting for water boiled

137
