# State Banquet Master Chef: Dry-braised winter bamboo shoots

# 简介

# 小友们好，今天带给大家一道冬季必吃的应季菜——干烧冬笋。
# 冬笋其实不太入味，配上炸过的雪菜叶，非常酥香脆嫩。
# 这道菜非常家常，做法也不难，但是细节还是很多的，大爷之前分享过的“劈柴块”刀功，大家还有印象吗？
# 还有什么冬季的时令菜大家想吃的？留言给老饭骨，大爷二伯教你们做！
# Hello friends! Today we are presenting a seasonal dish for winter - dry-braised winter bamboo shoots. In fact, it's hard for the bamboo shoots to absorb all the flavors. However, this dish is very crispy and delicious when served with fried potherb mustard leaves. You can cook easily it at home, but there are still plenty of details to pay attention to. Do you still remember the 'chop-wood' cutting skill taught by Da Ye? By the way, is there any other winter dishes that you want to learn? Please comment and Da Ye and Er Bai will show you how to cook!

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,440
# 要吃雪菜的脆嫩

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
# 它就不脆了
It's not crunchy any more

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,160

# 先关火 这边晾着
Turn off the fire. Cool it a bit

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,040
# 晾完了它才酥脆
The leaves will be crispy after cooling down

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
# 冬笋好了
Bamboo shoot is done

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
# 因为你没煮的时候
If you do not boil it (before cutting)

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,560
# 一切它就容易炸了
The shoot is going to crack once you cut it

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
# 就不容易出刀口
In that case, it's not beautiful

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,760
# 现在煮完了以后你看
Now, after boiling

55
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,920
# 一看就透了
You can easily cut through it

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,680
# 在大爷学堂里面有个刀工叫劈柴块
There is a special cutting skill, 'chop-wood' cut

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
# 什么叫劈柴块
What is a 'chop-wood' cut?

58
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
# 看着啊 不是切了
Look. This is not all about cutting

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,440
# 要把它这个丝纹路给拍松
You need to crack it through the fibers

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,520
# 现在已经松了你看
Now there's a crack

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,120
# 隋坡你看着啊
Look, Sui Po

62
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
# 剌开一口
Cut it from here

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
# 劈柴
'chop-wood'

64
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,800

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480

Tear it apart

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320

# 但是刀工处理上
But they always make mistakes

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,720
# 他的方法就错了
in terms of cutting the bamboo shoot

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
# 这叫劈柴块
This is the 'chop-wood' cut

72
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,280

# 搁这个淀粉以后炸出来有点虎皮色

80
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,600
