# 【国宴大师•黄焖羊肉】冬至必吃黄焖羊肉，筋道咸香，河南特色八大碗，忒棒了！ |老饭骨
# State Banquet Master Chef: Huang Men Yang Rou (Braised fried lamb)

# 简介

# 小友们好，今天是冬至，冬至是养生的大好时机，咱就得来一道羊肉！
# 有冬至吃水饺习惯的小友也可以复习一下之前做的鲜嫩多汁的【羊肉水饺】https://youtu.be/dugcZPi6VGE
# 俗话说“气始于冬至”，小友们一定要注意保暖，多吃有营养的食物，今天带来的这道黄焖羊肉是河南特色八大碗之一，羊肉先炸后蒸。炸羊肉的糊不是软炸糊也不是脆皮糊，炸完之后的这糊酥脆，一蒸就软和了，筋道咸香！
# 豫中平原这块儿，做菜都离不开十三香，加了十三香能够更加突出羊肉的鲜香，又不失其本味，忒棒！
# Hello friends! Today is winter solstice, a great chance to keep healthy - what's better than a lamb dish?
# For friends who enjoy dumplings on winter solstice day please also review our previous video: Lamb dumplings https://youtu.be/dugcZPi6VGE
# As a saying goes, 'Qi' (a concept for human energy in traditional Chinese medicine) starts from winter solstice. Hence, please keep yourself warm and eat more healthy food at this time. The dish in this video is one of the 'Eight Special Bowls' in Henan province, in which the lamb was first fried and steamed. The batter that we use here is neither soft-fry batter, nor crispy-fry batter. The batter we use today becomes crispy after frying, but turns soft and chewy after steaming.
# In the middle Henan plains, the '13 spices' appear in every dish. Specifically, the lamb in this dish tastes extra delicious with the '13 spices' without losing its original flavor.

That's right. Not 150 degrees yet

53

# 一定要离油近一点

57
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,560
# 越近它越不崩 挨着油下
The closer it is, the less oil will be splashed

58

# 他越害怕越烫手
You'll definitely burn yourself if you are afraid

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,040

# 你看刚才在腌制的
Look. The ginger and green onion that we use for marinating

61
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,000

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
# 它一炸稍微的一起就行了
As soon as the batter slightly swells up, it's done

63
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,920
# 一定要给它稍微炸干一点点
Make sure you fry it until it's dry

64
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,400
# 等一下咱们蒸的时候它会吸
The meat will absorb the...

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
# 完全吸收原汤
original broth when steaming

66
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,680
# 然后蒸出来更加酥烂
And it'll be more soft after steaming

67
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,400
# 咱们这就是一次炸成 一次炸好
We just need to fry it once

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,920
# 然后这时候咱们看这个糊
And the batter...

69
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,800
# 完全给它炸的就是
As you can hear

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320

the noise from colliding batter

71
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,640
# 而且咱们这个肉基本上也炸熟了
Also the meat is almost cooked now

# 有时候煮个羊肉
If you want to make a lamb soup

83
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,440
