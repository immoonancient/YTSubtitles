# State Banquet Master Chef - Abalone or Eggplant Box? Crispy, salty, and fresh, how to make home cooking look unfordable. LaoFanGu

# Introduction
# 小友们好，今天隋坡师傅给大家带来一道鲍鱼茄盒！
# Friends, Master Bo Sui will bring us an Abalone Eggplant Box today!
# 听这个名字就知道这个茄盒和我们平时吃的茄盒不太一样，这道菜形似鲍鱼，其实上下两片是一大一小两块茄子。
# By this name, you can know that this eggplant box is different from the one we usually eat. This dish looks like abalone. Its meat is layered with two different sizes of eggplant slices.
# 茄盒里面夹的肉馅小友们可以自行选择，鸡肉、鱼肉、虾肉这些都可以！
# The meat layered in the eggplant is flexible. You can repalce it with chicken, fish, shrimp, whatever meat you like.
# 值得注意的是糊的稀稠程度一定要把握好，这里我们用了150克的脆炸粉，120克的清水和20克纯净色拉油。
# It's worth noting that we should control the thickness of the batter. Here we used 150 grams of crispy fried powder, 120 grams of water, and 20 grams of pure salad oil.
# 要想做成鲍鱼的形状，一定要先煎后炸，煎得时候油温不要太高，4成就可以，炸一定得底儿朝上，这样才能定型。
# To make it look like abalone, we should pan-fry first, then deep-fry. The oil temperature should not be too high, almost 120 Celsius degree (248F). The smaller side of eggplant box should be upward while deep-grying, so that we can fix the shape(to make it look like abalone).
# 知识点都给小友们划好啦，一道简单家常的美味茄盒也可以做出不同的花样，小友们学会了快去厨房一展身手！
# The knowledge points are all marked out for you, dear friends. A homely, easy and delicious eggplant box can be so different as well. Just go the the kitchen and have a try!

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,840
# 对 它不容易变色

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,720
# 茄盒中间得加馅
The mince should be layered to the middle of the eggplant box.

33
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
# 这是肥瘦的猪肉馅

# 肉馅不加盐搅拌它不起粘度
The mince will not be sticky if we don't add some salt.

54
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,320
# 然后找一片小的
Then we find another small eggplant slice,

55
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
# 给它盖上
cover it.

56
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,360
# 这就已经出50%到60%的形状了
So far, it already looks like abalone, almost 50% tp 60%.

# 有点像了 这就像了
Kind of, it looks like (abalone) now.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,640
# 您要是两片大的合一块
If you layered two large eggplant slices together,

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
# 这就完蛋了 这就不大像了

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
# 那就是茄盒
That will be the usual eggplant box.

61
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,800
# 然后边上要放淀粉
Then we should add some starch around it,

62
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,400
# 你看它有一定的厚度
See, it is thick.

63
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,000
# 它才像鲍鱼那个边
It looks like the edge of abalone.

64
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,960
# 他这个比一般茄盒香
This one will be more delicious than the usual eggplant box,

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
# 大爷您知道为什么吗

# 实惠
Economical.

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
# 这个糊看得见吧
Look, this batter,

69
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,560
# 这是三两150克脆炸粉
this is 3 liang (150 grams) of crispy frying powder,

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,080
# 市场就有卖的

71
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,120
# 大约是120克的水
almost 120 grams of water,

72
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
# 一定是糊
It must be batter,

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
# 稀稠稍微得合适点
the thickness should be right,

74
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,840
# 太厚了 它不下去
It it is too thick, too much of batter will stick in the eggplant;

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
# 太薄了 是挂不住
If it is too thin, it will not stick with eggplant.

76
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,840
# 得反复的去搅拌
It would help if you stirred it again and again,

77
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,560
# 这个稀稠程度啊 它拉的线
To how thick? Until it can flow like a thread.

78
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
# 加点油 里边加点油
Add some oil. We should add some oil to the batter.

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
# 大约搁多少油呢
About how much?

80
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,320
# 20克纯净的色拉油
20 grams of pure salad oil,

81
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,000
# 起酥脆 使糊挺实的
to make it crispy.

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
# 一个关键的原料
It is a key ingredient.

83
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
# 你看这就行了
Looks, it is ok now.

84
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
# 这个鲍鱼茄盒
This abalone eggplant box,

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
# 要想达到鲍鱼这种形状
to make it look like abalone,

86
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,240
# 就得先煎后炸
we need to pan-fry it first, then deep-fry it with more oil.

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
# 隋坡一做我就知道了
I know it once Bo Sui do it,

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,680
# 因为他这糊啊 有油
Because he adds oil into the batter,

89
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
# 有油它起
it will swell if we deep-fry it directly.

90
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
# 这一煎就定了形不让它起
However, it won't swell if we pan-fry it and fix the shape of the larger side first.

91
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,560
# 但是后边一炸上边又起来了
But another smaller side will (swell) when deep-fry.

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,040
# 可不是呢 你看见没有
That's it. Look.

93
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,680
# 这点秘密都让二伯说明白了
Er Bai clarifies this secret.

94
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,080
# 大鲍鱼您看见没有大爷
A large abalone, do you see? Da Ye.

95
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,640
# 这鲍鱼够个儿
This abalone is large enough.

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,880
# 煎时候大约油温
How hot is the oil temperature when we pan-fry it?

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,960
# 咱们控制在四成就没有问题
Almost 120C (248F) is fine.

98
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
# 主要是为了让它变形
Just to fix the shape,

99
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,200
# 下边定型
fix the shape of the larger side.

100
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
# 下边您看定型了
You see, when the shape of the larger side is fixed,

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
# 就可以捞到油锅里边了
We can move it into the oil-wok (deep-fry it).

102
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,240
# 对 一定要让它倒着炸
Right, must deep-fry it upside down.

103
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,760
# 看底下 他不让它起
Look at the larger side. It won't swell.

104
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,000
# 定了型了底下
The shape of large side is fixed.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
# 必须是先煎后炸
It must be pan-fried first, then deep-fry it.

106
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,480
# 两锅要同时用
Two woks should work at the same time,

107
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,440
# 才能达到这种完美的状态
only by this, we can make it perfect.

108
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
# 你看这个正好露出黑边来
See, the black border is just exposed.

109
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,440
# 它就很像（鲍鱼）
It looks like abalone.

110
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
# 我们还得炸一遍
We need to deep-fry it again.

111
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
# 复炸一遍
Second deep-fry again.

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,600
# 几成油温 六成了 把馅要炸熟
How hot is the oil temperature? Almost 180C (356F), we should make the mince ready.

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
# 放纸上
Put it on the kitchen paper,

114
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,960
