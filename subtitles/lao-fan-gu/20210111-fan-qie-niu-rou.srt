# 【国宴大师•番茄牛肉】鲜美浓郁!搭配牛油果的番茄牛肉你一定没吃过!|老饭骨
# State Banquet Master Chef : Beef and Tomato

# 简介

# 大家好，今天由二伯带给大家一道鲜美浓郁的番茄牛肉！
# 这道菜可和我们平时吃过的西红柿炖牛腩可不一样。首先牛腩一定要用冷水去焯，撇出浮沫，并且要反复砸水，这样牛腩才能处理干净，炖牛腩的原汤才会干净！
# 番茄、西芹和洋葱用黄油炒过之后，加入牛肉汤煮一会儿，还要用粉碎机打碎，食材更加细腻，这样我们做出来的汤才会更加浓郁。
# 最后加入牛油果，搭配牛油果的牛肉会有一种特殊的香气，吃一口欲罢不能！
# 小友们快去试试看，这道家常番茄牛肉，真的不一般！
# Hello friends! Er Bai brings an amazingly delicious dish - Beef and Tomato!
# This dish is different from the tomato beef brisket stew that we usually have. Firstly, the beef brisket must be blanched with cold water with the scum removed immediately. Cold water should be added into the pot repeatedly to clean up the beef as well as the broth.
# The tomato, celery, and onion should be stir-fried with butter, boiled with the original beef broth, and crushed with a blender. In this way, the soup will be creamy, thick, and rich.
# Finally, the avacado will give a special aroma in combination with beef, which makes you never drop your chopsticks!
# Please try to cook this dish by yourselves - this home-made beef and tomato is incredible!
