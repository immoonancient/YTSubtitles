# State Banquet Master Chef- Super Star Braised Pork over Rice!

# 简介

# 小友们大家好，今天带来的这道菜可是卤肉饭的升级版——霸王卤肉饭！
# Hello everyone. Today we brought to you the advanced version of Braised Pork over Rice – Super Start Braised Pork over Rice!
# 大爷二伯最近学了个新词叫“干饭人”，霸王卤肉饭里面有大块的卤肉，肉香满满，大爷和二伯都忍不住化身“干饭人”武吃了！
# Da Ye and Er Bai learned a new phrase called “Gan Fan Ren” (i.e. a food lover who has a great appetite and never miss a meal). The Super Star Braised Pork over Rice is famous for the bigger size of the braised pork and the fulfilling meaty flavor and smell. Da Ye and Er Bai can’t wait to having it as Gan Fan Ren.
# 小魏师傅为了把菜做到极致，还加了玫瑰露酒，并且融入了山东葱烧海参的手法，不得不说，这碗卤肉饭实在太香了！小友们快学起来！
# Chef Xiao Wei took this dish to an extreme by adding rose wine and integrating the cooking method for Shandong Cuisine’s famous Sea Cucumber Fried with Spring Onion. There is no reason not to say this bowl of Super Star Braised Pork over Rice is amazing! Be sure to try it yourself!
