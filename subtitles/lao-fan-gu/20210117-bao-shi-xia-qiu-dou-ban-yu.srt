For this, we want to have a tender texture, so instead, we fry the food in oil with low heat

160

206
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
# 这鱼你看
Look at this fish

207
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
# 只能给切成两半了 没办法

# 现在的鱼炸的都非常干
The fried fish nowadays tends to be very dry

218
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
# 你看烧出鱼里边不嫩

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
# 它要求你炸七成熟
