00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,360
# 大团子 还真光溜啊
Big steamed buns. The surface is really smooth.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,480
# 就用这种办法 保证薄皮儿大馅儿
In this way, you can definitely get the buns with thin skin and full stuffing

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,720
# 有很多网友说这菜团子怎么包
Some friends asked me how to make steamed vegetable buns

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,080
# 我创造了一个新的手法
I invented a new technique

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,200
# 其实我也包不是特别专业
Actually I am not very professional in making buns

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,840
# 我们家是这样
In my home, it was like this

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,720
# 这个棒子面要烫棒子面
The cornmeal... You need to add boiling water

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,120
# 烫一半留一半
Mix half of the cornmeal with boiling water and keep the other half

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,000
# 大爷一瞧很专业啊
That looks professional, Da Ye

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,800
# 你看 二伯也懂
Er Bai knows this as well

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,600
# 烫一半
Mix half of the cornmeal with boiling water

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,760
# 今天这棒子面就比较细
The cornmeal here is very fine

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,280
# 还筋道
and somewhat tough

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,160
# 好了 这就可以了
Ok. That's done

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,720
# 但是我们还要搁一些凉水
But we still need to add some cold water

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,960
# 把它和匀了 和滋润了
To mix it up until it looks shiny

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
# 热水烫起到了决定性作用 黏糊了
Boiling water is the key. It's sticky now

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,840
# 以前特别逗
This is a funny story

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,560
# 十几岁我就会包这个菜团子
I could make this when I was a teenager

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,480
# 07年 大妈特别想吃个菜团子
In 2007, Da Ma really wanted to have this dish

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,600
# 完了以后我说没问题
I said, "No problem!"

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,720
# 我给你包个菜团子保证是薄皮大馅
"Let me make it for you. I am sure it must be full of stuffing with thin skin"

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,080
# 想吃我说包一个吧
Then I made some (steamed vegetable buns)

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
# 是棒子面的问题
I didn't know if the problem was with the cornmeal

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,240
# 是我的手艺问题
or my cooking skill

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,320
# 一包一裂口 一包一裂口
There were crackings on each of them!

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,720
# 然后我就拿面补
Then I filled the crackings with wheat flour

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
# 越补这面 这团子越大
But the steamed buns were getting bigger and bigger

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,440
# 咬了一口没咬着馅
You could not even touch the stuffing on your first bite

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,440
# 我们家老伴说了 瞧你这吹
My wife was like, 'You must be bluffing!'

32
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,920
# 隋坡再给我来点水 好嘞
Sui Po, get me some more water. Ok!

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
# 但是我还是不死心
But I didn't give up

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
# 过几天我说我再给你包一回
Several days later, I told her that I would make the buns again

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,440
# 这回保证薄皮大馅
I promised that they would be full of stuffing with thin skin

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,480
# 我创造了一个新的手法
I invented a new technique

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,040
# 是哪儿启发了我呢
What inspired me?

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
# 一会我给大家展示一下
I will show you later

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,680
# 这个面好了 然后让它饧一饧
The cornmeal is ready. Leave it to rest

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,080
# 下一步咱弄馅
Let's prepare the stuffing next

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,360
# 你看 这个红皮萝卜
Look. The red-skin radish here

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,920
# 我们常说的叫卞萝卜
We also refer to it as 'Bian' radish

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
# 这是个大圆的
This is a round one

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,920
# 这儿就用这个萝卜来擦的丝
These shreds are from the radish

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,480
# 这胡萝卜也是擦
Use the kitchen shredder to shred the carrot as well

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,800
# 这个是略焯 不要焯太大发了
Blanch it shortly. Do not blanch for too long

47
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,840
# 略焯
Just a little while

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,120
# 好了
Done

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,600
# 冲凉
Rinse with cold water

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,400
# 你看胡萝卜白萝卜出完水了 冲凉了
After rinsing the shredded radish with water

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,960
# 给它挤挤水
Squeeze the water out

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,960

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
# 木耳
Black wood ear mushroom

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,240
# 这个蛋皮丝可以
Shredded fried egg

55
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,720
# 也可以炒点碎碎的鸡蛋
You can replace it with eggs that are fried into tiny bits

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
# 二伯 来
Er bai, come on

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,480
# 把萝卜丝揽两刀
Simply chop the shredded radish

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,120

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,440
# 看着啊 粉丝准备好了 油也热了
Look. The vermicelli is ready. The oil is also hot

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,120

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
# 看见了吧 特别简单
See that? Very simple

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,920
# 这就好了 再来
This is done. Again

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
# 就搁这儿就行
Place it here

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,400
# 一会儿给它斩一斩
Let' s cut it later

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,320
# 或者让它晾一晾拿手一揉
Or cool it down and crush with your hand

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
# 炸完以后它就已经熟了
It's already cooked after frying

68
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
# 还香呢炸完了
It also smells better

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
# 你看拿刀轻轻一斩
Look. Simply chop it with the knife

70
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,960
# 在素馅里边 这粉丝是必须要给的
In vegetable stuffing, you must have vermicelli

71
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,640
# 为什么呢 有的素菜它会出水
Why? Some vegetables may be juicy and will give out moisture

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
# 出水怎么办 搁点粉丝
How to deal with that? Add some vermicelli

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,200
# 另外它还产生了香气
Also the vermicelli enhances the aroma

74
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,720
# 好了 现在要调味了
Good. Now let's season it

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
# 素馅调味的不加酱油
Soy sauce does not go well with vegetable stuffing

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
# 先把盐加上 这盐要不能少
Add salt first. Not too little

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,080
# 因为团子（有面）
Since the buns (are made of cornmeal and are bland)

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,240
# 一勺不够 两勺 两勺半盐
One teaspoon is not enough. Two, two and a half teaspoons of salt

79
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,000
# 盐搁完了 白胡椒
After the salt, white pepper powder

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,760

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,240
# 香油
Sesame oil

82
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,480
# 馅儿一好 咱就开始了
Let's start when the stuffing is ready

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,840
# 来 二伯给倒上 倒点味精
Come on, Er Bai. Add some MSG

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
# 手拌馅是最快的 而且还拌的匀
It's the fastest to mix the stuffing with your hands. Also it can be mixed more evenly.

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,400
# 来点葱姜
Some ginger and green onion

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,560
# 还得来点油吗 来油啊
Some more oil? Yes, please

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
# 还得炼点儿油呢
Let's prepare some oil as well

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,560
# 搁点葱尾巴 香葱
Some green onion leaves. Scallion

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
# 香菜 搁个大料
Coriander. A star anise

90
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,720

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,360
# 还很香这个油 很香 再搁点料油
The oil is very aromatic. Some more oil please

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
# 我还得讲刚才的故事 接着讲
Let me continue to tell my previous story

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,360
# 我就奇怪了
I was wondering

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,240
# 我说我现在厨艺有点下降了
I was like, 'Does my cooking skill deteriorate?'

95
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,640
# 后来我想了个诀窍 什么诀窍呢
Later on I invented a trick. What was it?

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
# 有一次 正好什么启发了我呢
There was one time... when I was inspired

97
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,040
# 包一个一斤半的狮子头
Making a 750-g Shi Zi Tou (Literally lion head, braised pork ball in brown sauce)

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,840
# 里边还要上馅儿 谁也包不上去
We needed to put stuffing inside as well. No one could do it

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
# 我忽然间就启发了
It suddenly came to my mind that

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
# 找一个保鲜膜找一大碗
I found a piece of plastic wrap and a big bowl

101
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,680
# 把肉馅打好了以后铺在保鲜膜上
Placed the minced meat on the plastic wrap

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,160
# 给它抹圆乎了抹均匀了
Spreaded it evenly

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,000
# 然后把炒好的素馅装进去
Then placed cooked vegetable stuffing inside

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,040
# 这是一斤（肉）馅儿啊
That was 500 grams of minced meat

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,640
# 然后再称了半斤馅儿
Then I got 250 more grams of minced meat

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,800
# 再把底儿一封 拿保鲜膜一兜
to seal the bottom. Then I wrapped up the plastic wrap

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
# 二伯 这么大一狮子头
Er Bai, the lion head was like this big

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,320
# 包的好好的光溜溜的
It was perfect and smooth

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
# 我就想起这个来了
This inspired me

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,320
# 今天呢
Today

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
# 我这个方法给大家重现一下
I will show you this technique

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,880
# 你看找一个合适的碗
Look. Find a right bowl

113
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,600
# 把这面搁里头
Put the cornmeal inside

114
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,040
# 首先要把碗底儿的皮给它抹的均匀
Make sure the skin underneath is even in thickness

115
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,000
# 你看看 都已经成一碗状了
Look. It already looks like a bowl

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
# 这时候我们往里边盛馅儿
Let's add stuffing now

117
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,440
# 这个菜团子的馅儿得足实
You need enough stuffing for the steamed bun

118
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,000
# 你看啊 装好了吧
See that? The bun is filled with stuffing

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,280
# 一起一提了 出来了
Lift it up. Out of the bowl

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,240
# 首先我相信我底下这个皮儿是薄的
Firstly, I am sure that the skin at the bottom is thin

121
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,880
# 然后我们一点一点的
Then let's seal it, little-by-little

122
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,240
# 拢的时候手里沾点水
Apply some water in your hand

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,560
# 要不它粘的哪儿都是 馅儿都跑了
Otherwise it's gonna stick to everywhere. The stuffing will be gone

124
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
# 一边拢着一边蹲
Close it slowly while 'sitting' it to the bottom

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,440
# 越蹲越收口
The opening will be closed as you 'sit' it

126
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,280
# 那天我看什么大饼 肉饼
I was watching (others making) meat pies the other day

127
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,080
# 那疙瘩面不很多 那块肉可不少
I noticed that the dough was small, but there was a lot of meat

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,600
# 三团两团
But somehow, as he 'sat' the meat stuffing into the dough

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
# 把这一大块肉给团进去了
The whole pile of meat stuffing was closed in the skin

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,640
# 二伯看见了吧 你看你看
Er Bai, see that?

131
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,360
# 这口越来越小
The opening is getting smaller and smaller

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,320
# 这得有耐心 大爷的耐心够大的
You need to be patient. Da Ye has great patience

133
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,960
# 一点一点
Little by little

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,280

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,200
# 你看也不漏
Look, no cracking

136
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
# 圆圆乎乎的吧
They are round now

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,440
# 上锅了 一开锅十五分钟
Into the pot. 15 minutes after boiling

138
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,760
# 得嘞 我看时间 您歇会
Okay. I'll keep an eye on the time and you can have a rest

139
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,200
# 二伯 蒸了十五分钟
Er Bai. Steamed for 15 minutes,

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
# 闷了有一分多钟
rest with the lid closed for about 1-2 minutes

141
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,920
# 薄皮大馅 走着
Full stuffing, thin skin. Let's go!

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,520
# 还真光溜 不错
So smooth. Looks good

143
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,360
# 晾晾晾晾 下不了手
Cool it for a while. Can't touch it now

144
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,960
# 好啦 大团子
Done. Big steamed buns!

145
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,760
# 黄澄澄金灿灿的大团子
Golden yellow buns!
