# State Banquet Master Chef: Golden and Crispy Chives Pockets

# 简介

# 小友们好，今天给大家带来一道家常面点——韭菜盒子！
# 做好韭菜盒子关键在于调馅儿，这次我们做的是猪肉虾仁韭菜馅儿的盒子，虾仁加上韭菜，鲜上加鲜！
# 炒葱花用的是大葱花，煸至金黄色，这样香味才更足。做馅颜色不能太重，所以加酱油不要放老抽。
# 大家煎馅饼的时候可能会遇到做馅饼容易露馅儿的问题，小友们在家如果用电饼铛来做，馅饼一定不要做得太厚。
# 馅饼遇热中间会起鼓，如果馅饼做得太厚，电饼铛的盖儿会影响馅饼起鼓，就容易露馅儿。所以可以选用平底锅来煎。
# 煎出的韭菜盒子表面金黄酥脆，一口下去虾肉和韭菜鲜香多汁，一盘根本吃不够！
# Hello friends, today we introduce a family style pastry: chives pockets!
# The key to make good chives pockets lay in the stuffing. We are making chives pockets with pork and shrimps. The aroma of shrimps and chives goes perfectly together. We are using the big green onions and frying them till golden. Therefore, the flavor can really come out. We use the soy sauce but not dark soy sauce so the color is still fresh. Some of you may had problems of breaking the shape of pockets when cooking. If you cook them on an electrical pan fryer, don’t make the pockets too thick. The stuffing in the pocket will inflate when heated, and the lid of the pan fryers may pressure them to break. So we can use pans instead. The chives pockets have golden crispy wraps, and juicy delicious shrimp and chives stuffing. One plate of them is not enough!

# 窍门在这呢吧
So that’s the trick

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,920
# 这葱太小了它还没有释放出香味
The small green onions don’t have enough flavor

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,520
# 它就糊掉了 要煸到金黄色
They get burnt too fast. We need to fry them till golden

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,240
# 它才能出这个味道
That’s when the flavor get out

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080

# 酱油要炸一下
Soy sauce in the frying wok

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,840

# 这个味道就出来了
There the flavor goes

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,160
# 酱油遇热起泡
The soy sauce starts to bubble when heated

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,080
# 迅速它就挥发出香味了
And the flavor comes out quickly

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,680
# 然后把它倒在旁边 晾一晾
Let’s put this aside and let it cool off

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,400
# 所以吃韭菜馅这葱一定煸熟放进去
For stuffing with chives, the green onions need to be fried

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,880
# 这放在旁边 晾一晾
Put this aside and cool off

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,000
# 面是和好了的
We have already made the dough

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
# 咱们选用的是中筋粉
We chose to use the medium gluten flour

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
# 一斤面是七两水
350 grams of water for every 500 grams of flour

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,360
# 和完之后要饧它十分钟
Let the dough rest for 10 minutes after mixing

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,000
# 然后拿手再揉一遍
Then we knead the dough once again

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
# 表面就润了之后再饧一会儿
After the dough has a smooth surface, let it rest again

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
# 不饧它还是有筋
The resting help soften the gluten

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,800
# 没法去做这个剂
Otherwise it is hard to make the rolls

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,360
# 把面和好之后咱们就开始要和这个馅
After the dough, let’s mix the stuffing

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
# 肥瘦猪肉 虾仁 姜米
Ground pork with some fat, shrimps and garlic pieces

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
# 姜还可以有祛寒 去腥味的作用
Garlic adds some spice to it and gets rid of the gamey smell

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,920
# 猪肉馅呢 往里边加点葱
Put some green onions in the ground pork

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,800
# 做好的酱油倒进去 已经凉了
Pour the soy sauce we made in there. It is already cooled down

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
# 猪肉虾仁馅呢
For the pork and shrimp stuffing

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,080
# 你不能颜色就太重了
We don’t make the color too dark

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,800
# 搁点酱油你不能搁老抽
Some soy sauce, but not the dark soy sauce

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,080
# 一点点加
Add the soy sauce in a few times

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,760
# 盐 三克
Three grams of salt

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,800
# 胡椒粉 两克
Two grams of pepper

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,280
# 这个还不能打得很软
The stuffing cannot be too watery right now

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,880
# 因为这韭菜还会出汤
Because the chives contain some water too

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,000
# 所以要黏乎一点
So let it be a little sticky for now

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,080
# 闻一下
Have a smell

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,800
# 行 这样呢
Alright

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,160
# 咱把这虾仁就放进去了
Now we can put the shrimps in

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,920
# 虾仁咱们方便的时候可以用
If you have much time

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
# 葱姜水先泡一下
Marinate the shrimps with garlic and green onions first

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
# 多洗两遍
Wash it a few more times too

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,560
# 刚剥完这种虾仁还有一些不干净的
The peeled shrimps can have filth

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
# 也有一些粘液
Like the mucus

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
# 然后把切好的韭菜倒进去
Then pour the cut chives in

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
# 其实吃虾馅搁韭菜是最好的
The shrimp goes perfectly with the chives

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,480
# 但是有的人可能不吃韭菜
But some people don’t like chives

54
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
# 咱们来点香油
Let’s have some sesame oil

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,160
# 包馅无论是饺子还是馅饼
For stuffing, either dumplings or pies

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
# 尽可能的咱们要使用不好料酒
Hold the cooking wine if you don’t know what you are doing

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
# 不要用了 因为它包在里边
Because it will be contained within

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,560
# 这个料酒不容易往外挥发
The alcohol is hard to evaporate

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
# 你掌握不好就别用了
Hold it if you are not sure

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,480
# 这大家伙要注意
Be careful guys

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,600
# 这就行了
This should be good

62
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,640
# 咱们弄面
Now let’s work with the dough

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,040
# 这个面三十多度三十五度的水
The water for the dough need to be from 30 to 35 degrees Celsius

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
# 然后一斤面七两水就和成这样了
Then a 10:7 flour water ratio will give you a dough like this

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,320
# 但是有点软
It’s a bit soft though

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,280
# 软的时候咱们上面掸一点薄面
When the dough is too soft, dust some excessive flour on there

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,320
# 咱把它拿出来它不粘手
So it doesn’t stick to your hands when you grab it

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
# 要硬了它就不好吃了
The hard dough will not make a good texture for the pocket

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
# 你看这盆也比较干净
Take a look, the pot is pretty clean as well

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
# 和好的面
When the dough is made

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,960
# 饧置十分钟十五分钟之后
After a 10-15 minutes rest

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,320
# 就不能再揉了 上劲了
We cannot knead the dough anymore

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,320
# 咱们做一个剂 六十克
Let’s make a roll, about 60 grams

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,160
# 六十克的面团
A 60 gram dough

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,400
# 咱们要把它擀到直径十二厘米大小
We will roll it to a diameter about 12 centimeters

76
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
# 这个面很软
The dough is soft

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,960
# 馅饼边上要薄一点
For pie wraps, the edge need to be thinner

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
# 中间要厚一点
The center need to be thicker

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
# 最后捏褶的时候
So that when we nip it together

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,360
# 它中间的疙瘩不会很大
The lump in the middle won’t be too big

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,040
# 我记得我小时候
When I was little

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
# 妈妈给我烙那个馅饼
The pies my mom made me

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,240
# 永远都是中间一大疙瘩一点馅没有
Always had a huge lump in the center, with no stuffing at all

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,000
# 十二（厘米）
Twelve centimeters

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,080
# 大约呢包上六十克的馅
With about 60 grams of stuffing

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,080
# 包的时候 捏这小边 一点点
When we wrap it, nip just a small tip of the edge slowly

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,560
# 转着圈的捏
Rotate and nip

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
# 你看它中间 它不是一大硬疙瘩
See the middle here, not a big lump

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,240
# 没那么大然后中间的时候捏一下
Nip it together in the middle to close it

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
# 可以往回盖一下 这样就可以了
And then push it back a bit, done

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,960
# 捏的时候注意 捏上边一点 一边
When we nip it, be careful to just nip a tiny bit

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,600
# 一点一点往起兜
Nip the bit up and then nip together

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,960
# 左手是往里填馅用的
Your left hand can push the stuffing in during the same time

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,480
# 如果冒出来了你就使手按它一下
If the stuffing is coming out, just push it back

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,320
# 中间它不是疙瘩
Not a lump in the middle

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,160
# 弄完之后咱们就要翻着放
Then we put it upside down after done

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,560
# 搁在面粉的案板上边
On a chopping board with flour on it

98
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,720
# 擀一下 轻点
Roll it very gently

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,640
# 看着要露馅了
When you see the stuffing is going to burst

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,640
# 翻过来 擀一擀
Flip it over and then roll

101
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
# 也擀到要露馅了 咱们就下锅
When the stuffing is going to come out on the other too, it is ready to cook

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,440
# 薄面抖一抖
Dust the excessive flour off

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,840
# 今天我们使平底锅来煎馅饼
We are frying our pockets with a pan

104
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,960
# 如果我们在家要是用电饼铛烙
We may also be cooking with an electrical pan fryer

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,240
# 咱们家庭式的电饼铛 槽比较浅
The ones in families have a rather thinner groove

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,280
# 热饼铛 放进去之后
So that when we put the pockets in

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
# 馅饼表面的淀粉 面粉
The starch and flour at the surface of the pockets

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
# 迅速糊化凝结成壳了
Will get burnt and sealed

109
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,320
# 馅儿里边遇热 它会出起鼓来
The stuffing inside will inflate when heated

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,520
# 如果说您馅饼特别厚
If you made the pockets thick

111
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
# 它在起鼓的时候
When they inflate

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,640
# 电饼铛的盖 就会影响它长
The cap of the electrical pan fryer will pressure on them

113
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,200
# 这时候它就会从两边会露馅
Then the stuffing will come out from the edges

114
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,320
# 就破了 就顶破了
They will break the shape

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,400
# 所以要用饼铛的话最好不要太厚
So if you are cooking with those electrical pan fryers, do not make the pockets too thick

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,800
# 跟饼铛的槽一样高
At most as think as the groove when cooked

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
# 如果是生胚的话 会矮到一半
Which is half as thick before cooking

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
# 盖上盖 盖上盖歇一会
Put the lid on

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,200
# 盖盖煮皮 盖盖烙皮
With the lid, the pan cooks the wraps

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,960
# 馅饼的表面起鼓了
When the surface starts to inflate

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,160
# 证明里面的肉蔬菜还有虾都熟了
It means the meat, veggies and the shrimps in there are cooked

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,400
# 它只有熟了以后
They can only generate the steam

123
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
# 它才能产生热的蒸汽
After they are cooked

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,880
# 出锅啦
Ready to get out

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,440
# 韭菜盒子
Chives pockets

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,040
# 你们得吃一个
You guys have to try an entire one

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,360
# 半拉不够吃
Half of it won’t get you satisfied

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,200
# 吃半拉不过瘾 得吃一个
You will still be carved after half, finish it in whole

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
# 赶紧吃吧 不吃就没了

# 这是虾肉 这大虾肉
See the shrimp here, big pieces

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
# 我也看得嘴馋了 你也来一个
I’m hungry too. Try one too

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
# 摄影师也尝一个 元国来一个吃
Let’s have one for our photographer and Yuanguo

133
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,280
# 这馅饼香
The pocket is so good

134
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
# 特别是酱油 它炸这葱花
Especially for the soy sauce. The green onions fried is exceptional

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,040
# 呲的熟油 这熟油呢
The oil added in the stuffing is cooked

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,480
# 真的 一个是非常提鲜
Really improves the aroma

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,560
# 虾跟韭菜绝搭
The shrimp goes perfectly with chives

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,560
# 这盘吃完了 上菜
We are done with this plate. We need more

139
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,080
# 接着上 第二盘
There you go, second plate
