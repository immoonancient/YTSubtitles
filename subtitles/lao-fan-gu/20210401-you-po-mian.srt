# |--------------------------- title should not be longer than this line ----------------------------|

# 简介

# 小友们好，今天给大家带来一碗小友们呼声特别高的陕西油泼面！
# Hello friends, today we bring a bowl of long called-for Shanxi Biang Biang Noodles!
# 油泼面的关键是面条要做得筋道，“盐是筋、碱是骨”，一斤面要搁上2克的碱，放上四两半的水，这样做出来的软硬刚合适。
# The key to Biang Biang noodles is that the noodles need to be al dente, "Salt and alkali are the muscles and bones," 1 jin (500 g) flour goes with 2 g of dietary alkali and 4.5 liang (225 g) water, so the dough wouldn't be too hard or too soft.
# 面最好要提前糖一糖，面糖得好做出来的效果才好。糖好的面一拉、一摔，像裤腰带一样的面条就做成了！
# It's best to rest the dough for a while -- only well-rested dough can make good noodles. Take the dough, stretch, and smash it on the counter, and here we have noodles that look like woven belts!
# 这次我们做的油泼面的浇头有加上之前炸葱油剩下的葱，大家伙儿也可以根据口味选择不加。
# This time we have the fried scallions from making scallion oil as a topping on the noodles, but everyone can decide to add/not add it based on taste.
# 最后淋上热好的菜籽油，“呲啦”一声响，劲道爽滑、香辣过瘾的陕西油泼面就做好了！
# Lastly, pour hot oil over the noodles. With the sizzling sound, the tasty, chewey and spicy Biang Biang noodles are ready!

# （有碱）面吃的筋道

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,040
# 就硬一点
But a little harder

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,320
# 基本一斤面四两半水就行
Generally 1 jin (500 g) flour goes with 4.5 liang (225 g) water

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,880
# 网友们记住了啊

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,440
# 你要放五两水它就软了
If you put 5 liang (250 g) water the dough would be too soft

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,800
# 不好了 就成了饺子面了
That would be a dumpling dough, but not good for this

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,760
# 刚强同志把最累的活交给元国了
Gangqiang Tongzhi just gave the hardest labor to Yuango

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,000
# 饧五分钟咱再揉一遍

# 你先饧着我这耗着葱油
