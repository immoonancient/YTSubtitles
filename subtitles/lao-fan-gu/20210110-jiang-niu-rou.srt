# 小友们好，今天是元旦佳节，也是2021年的第一天！
# 老饭骨在这里感谢小友们长久以来的支持与陪伴，新的一年祝大家万事如意，好心情好胃口！
# 这期视频掌勺的是小亮师傅，看看这次大家喜爱的冯肉肉又带给我们什么横货了！
# 小亮这次带来他的酱牛肉配方，酱牛肉其实家家都会做，但味道各不相同。
# 这次我们主要把步骤分为腌制和卤制，腌制要放冰箱里24小时，把酱全部吃进肉里！
# 卤制小友们可以按照小亮师傅的配方，只需六种料：白芷、白蔻、小茴香、花椒、大料和香叶。做出来的酱包还可以放进冰箱冻上，能再用两次。
# 做出来的酱牛肉酱香浓郁，筋软肉酥超级入味！小友们还等什么，快跟着视频学起来！

# Hello Friends, Today is the first day of 2021. Lao Fan Gu really appreciated your long-term support and company. May everyone have a wonderful new year, a good mood and a good appetite!
# Today's video is about a braised beef recipe from Master Xiaoliang. The recipe is his own take.
# It's a two-step process, marination and braising. The marination takes 24 hours for the best results.
# The spices used in the brining process: Baizhi, White cardamom, fennel seeds, Sichuan peppercorns, Star anise, and bay leaves.
# The spice mix can be used three times, just remember to keep it frozen after each use.

# The braised beef will be rich in flavour and tender, let's get started!
