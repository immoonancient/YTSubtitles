First of all,…

112
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,240
# 猪蹄回来之后
… after you bought the pork feet,…

113
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,720
# 一定要泡两三个小时以上
…you have to soak it in water for over 2-3 hours.

115
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,640
# 泡完之后还要再用长流水

116
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,480
# 冲个五分钟左右

117
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
# 继续的把它的腥味去掉

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
# 然后焯水一定是冷水下锅

# 然后更加的去掉它的毛腥味
Consequently, such prep will remove its gamey taste all together.

121
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,400
# 做的时候非常关键的两个东西
Two key points when you slow-cook the dish.

122
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
# 第一个白芷

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
# 但不能多 增加它的肉香味
You can’t add too much. The purpose is to enhance the aroma of the meat.

124
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,120
# 然后再放一点点的当归 很少
And add a little bit dong quai. Very little.

125
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,280
# 能够增加汤的浓郁的香味
Enough to increase the strong aroma in the soup.

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
# 再一个最关键的点

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
# 一定要让它烂乎
