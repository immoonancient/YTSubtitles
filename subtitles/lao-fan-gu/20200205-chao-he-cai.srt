# 小友们好，今天老饭骨给你们带来一个节令性强的菜品：炒合菜•卷春饼。

# Chao He Cai is Bei Jing's traditional dish. As a Bei Jing dish, it has certain requirements. 
# 炒合菜，是北京市传统的特色名菜，属于京菜系，在北方也是一种讲究的菜品。

# 这道菜有两个个特点：一是节令性强，立春日必不可少；
# 二是吃“炒合菜”需要春饼卷食，方能品出味道。
# This dish has two specialties, first is that it's seasonal, is a must have in Li Chun 
# Second is "Chao He Cai" needs to be eaten with wraps, to bring out it's intended taste

# 它将胡萝卜，韭菜、肉丝、粉丝、豆芽菜、小菠菜等一起炒制，
# 成菜肉丝滑嫩，豆芽爽脆，菠菜多汁，
# 和粉丝一起组合成爽口多汁含有复合口感的味道，
# 再配上蛋饼，以春饼卷食，真是妙哉啊！
# It has carrots, chives, meat strips, vermicelli, bean sprouts, baby spinaches
# This dish combines tendor meat strips, crunchy bean sprouts and juicy baby spinaches

# 其中的知识点：切肉丝的手法为什么会像螃蟹一样？三叔为你解答疑惑。
# 熟悉老饭骨的朋友们知道，油封已多次在不同视频中出现了，为什么肉丝需要用油封？
# 为何先放菜再放肉？最后放韭菜的目的是什么？
# (to be translated)

# 当然，这道菜卷春饼也是一大特色。
# 烙饼并没有太多的难度，这道菜的重点在于要保留面饼和菜的香味冲撞的复合味道，
# 所以面饼不应擀得太薄，小友们一定注意！

# 这些都是做菜的小秘诀，大家可要记笔记呀！
