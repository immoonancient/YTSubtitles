# |--------------------------- title should not be longer than this line ----------------------------|

# 简介

# 小友们好，后天就是腊八节了，大爷在这里教各位小友用爱熬一碗暖心的腊八粥！
# Hello everyone, since the day after tomorrow is Laba Festival, Da Ye is here to teach you how to make a heart-warming Laba congee!
# 咱们今天做的这个腊八粥配料非常丰富，有大米、小米、鸡头米、江米、高粱米、花生米、红小豆、绿豆、红芸豆、白芸豆、桂圆、莲子、小枣儿、核桃仁、南瓜子、藜麦、栗子、葡萄干、碱面！小友们快数数看，一共有多少种配料？
# We are using a plenty of types of ingredients, including rice, millet, gorgon fruit, jiang glutinous rice, sorghum, peanuts, red beans, mung beans, red kidney beans, white kidney beans, dried longan fruit, lotus seeds, small dates, wulnuts, pumpkin seeds, quinoa, chestnuts, raisin, dietary alkali. So how many types of ingredients did you count?
# 熬腊八粥可不能一股脑儿把所有料都下进去，每种食材都要讲究顺序，像芸豆这种不爱烂的要单独压一会儿，这样做出来的腊八粥喝起来才有层次感。
# You should never put all ingredients at once when making Laba congee. They come at a carefully arranged sequence. For example, ingredients that are hard to cook through, like kidney beans, should be pressure-cooked for some time alone. As a result, you would enrich the depth of Laba congee.
# 大爷做这粥的时候一直守在锅边，算着时间一步步下食材，才能熬出这样一碗充满爱的腊八粥。
# While making the congee, Da Ye has been watching the pot, counting the minutes, and adding in the materials at the right moment. This dedication filled the Laba Congee with love.
# 不知道大家伙儿有没有想起自己的母亲，无论你起多早，等待你的永远都是那一碗热气腾腾的粥。
# I don’t know if this reminds you of your mom. No matter how early you woke up, a hot, steamy congee would always be awaiting.
# 学会的小友可别忘了，在腊八节，做给你们爱的人吃！
# Once you learned this, don’t forget to make it for the people you love in Laba Festival.

# 我需要一锅粥的时候

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
# 我这水不能马上兑到一锅水
I shouldn’t fill the pot with water at the beginning.

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,520
# 这样这豆就不爱烂

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,920
# 这是第一环节先煮着
This is the first step. Let’s cook it on the side.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,040
# 这芸豆是最不爱烂的
The kidney beans is the least easy to get cooked through.

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,080
# 做这个东西要有点层次感
If we want to enrich the depth of the congee,

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,280
# 就是分头单独给它压一下
We should pressure-cook the beans alone

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,320
# 大约得压将近10分钟
Which would take about 10 minutes

25

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
# 让它慢慢开
Let the pot slowly boiled.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,640
# 二伯给盖上
Put on a lid, Er Bai.

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,120
# 过了腊八就是节
The Spring Festival comes right after Laba Festival.

31
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,880
# 初九初十就开始准备年夜饭了
On the 9th and 10th of the Lunar Year, people start to prepare the meal for the Spring Festival Eve.

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,360
# 因为它也不爱烂
Because it is also hard to cook through.

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
# 把枣放进去
Add the small dates.

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,840

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,160
# 这都是不爱烂的就早点放
Add these ingredients that are hard to cook through

41
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,720
# 我再把这个栗子给它处理一下
Let me prep the chestnut.

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
# 栗子得剥皮
First peel the skin.

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
# 把那头必须得切了 它好剥呀
Cut off that end so it is easy to peel.

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
# 好多人忽视了这个

00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,120

# 如果说要放在粥里边
Adding the alkali to the congee

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,160
# 它起的黏性东西特别好
Would make the congee glutinous and slimy.

48
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,520
# 二伯 劳驾 是不是大爷
Er Bai, please comment. Da Ye, am I right?

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,920
# 在农村要是熬粥啊
In the rural village, people always cook congee

# 都搁碱 出来特别好吃

# 你要熬什么大棒碴粥 你必须得搁
Like, to make Da Bang Cha Congee (similar to Polenta), you have to add alkali.

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,640
# 你看这绿豆 红小豆
Take a look at the mung beans, red beans

# 高粱米不乱汤是吧
The soghum won’t mess up the congee right?

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
# 不乱汤 放棒子碴就不爱乱汤
No it won’t as long as you are adding the grounded dried corns

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,680

Not the corn starch

62
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,160

# 这个栗子 只要开锅

# 送到药房 高价收购

# 投入到腊八粥 喝的时候

# 粥黏 又香 比较有层次感

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
# 让它开锅 让它翻滚
Wait till the congee is boiled

94
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,840
# 那东西一沉底儿就容易扒锅
If the congee gets too thick and the ingredients sink, it would get dried up and stick to the bottom

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
# 就容易糊锅
And eventually get charred.

96
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,600

# 那粥都给你熬好了
She would have the congeed ready for you.

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,360
# 这就是父母用心的那种爱
This is the type of love from parents.

112
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
# 其实我们要做的什么
What we should actually be doing,

113
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,720
# 就继承这种 是吧

# 这一年到头喝的都是稀粥
I grow up drinking gruel (thin congee) all year long.

118
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,400
# 只有到腊八了
Only when Laba Festival comes,

119
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,480
# 家里边还能喝一回糨粥
We could afford to have a richer congee.

120
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
# 比吃肉香
It is better than having meat.

121
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
# 吃了这么多年的腊八粥
Years of having Laba congee.

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,560
# 今天我算见识到了高配版
I finally see a high-end version.

123
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,720
# 要是我在家里边 就像我这个岁数
If I am at home, in my age,

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
# 我也是一下全把搁进去
I would also add everything in at once.

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
# 搁里边熬着去了
So they are cooked together.

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
# 熬那个腊八粥不是这样熬
But Laba Congee should not be made like that.

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,920
# 熬粥是分步骤 分层次
There are steps for cooking congee to create a sense of depth.

128

# 一步一步的去做的

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,920
# 因为今天这粥从始至终我看了
I got that because I was watching the cooking process from the beginning to the end.

130
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,760
# 大爷一直走在锅边
I saw Da Ye sitting by the pot the whole time.

131
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,640
# 这就是咱老一辈人
This is our older generation

132
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
# 咱们的前辈
Our senior

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,240
# 就是说人家做事的一个态度
I am appreciating their persistent attitudes in doing things

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,760
# 你看简简单单一个粥都是如此
Even in cooking congee

135
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
# 何况说做其他的菜
Let alone other dishes

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,520
# 希望我们在家里边熬个粥
I hope that whenever we cook Laba congee at home

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
