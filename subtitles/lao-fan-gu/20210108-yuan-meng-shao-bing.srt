# 为什么这么说呢，相传老佛爷有次梦见吃火烧夹肉末，第二天御膳房恰巧做了这道肉末烧饼，就圆了慈溪太后这个梦！
# And why is that? One night, Cixi (or the royal name -- Lao Fo Ye) had a dream of eating Shaobing stuffed with grounded meat. Surprisingly, without any conversation, the imperial kitchen put the same dish on her table the second day!
# 炒肉馅呢二伯还有个20字小口诀，大家伙可要记好咯！

# 字幕

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
# 不就烧饼加肉吗
So, just Shaobing and grounded meat. That’s pretty predictable.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,800
# 不是加肉 哥
You would think, brother.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
# 这叫圆梦烧饼
This is Cixi Shaobing.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,440
# 圆了慈禧一个梦
This Shaobing brings Empress Dowager Cixi’s dream to life!

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,360
# 圆梦烧饼
So we call it Yuan Meng (“dream come true”) Shaobing.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,360
# 先和面吧大爷 先和面
Let’s make the dough first, Da Ye.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,480
# 中筋粉 一斤
1 jin (500g) All-purpose Flour

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,960
# 酵母8克
8 g Yeast

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,240
# 白糖是60克
60g Cane Sugar

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,160
# 水是四两九
4 liang 9 qian (245g) Water

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,360
# 温水吧得 温水温水
Have to use warm water. Warm water.

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,080
# 全是标准
Talking about standard.

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
# 给它化开了 酵母
Resolve the yeast in water.

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,640
# 冬天天凉多放点酵母没事
Since it’s winter (cold), it’s ok to use more yeast here.

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
# 这就是一关键点
This actually a key point.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,600
# 一定要多放点
You gotta use more yeast.

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,360
# 夏天就放5克就够了
If you are making this in summer (hot), 5g is enough.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,880
# 什么程度是软面呀
What makes it a soft dough?

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
# 稍微硬一点
We need to knead it to just a bit harder.

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,600
# 跟饺子面差不多
(soft dough here) is similar to the dough for Jiaozi skin (Chinese dumpling skin).

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
# 老佛爷怎么想起
How comes CIxi think of…

22
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,680
# 要吃肉末烧饼
Eating Shaobing stuffed with grounded meat?

23
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,400
# 老佛爷做的梦啊
It’s in Cixi’s dream.

24
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,840
# 老佛爷做梦 您都知道
Oh like you would know Cixi had a dream.

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,800
# 梦见
Yea.

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
# 用这火烧夹这肉沫一吃
She dreamed of eating Shaobing (the actual name referred here is “Huoshao”, which is a type of Chinese Shaobing) stuffed with ground meat.

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
# 第二天的御膳房呢
The second day,

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
# 恰巧就做了一个肉末
The Imperial kitchen actually prepared such a dish for her

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:51,880

30
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
# 这么巧
In such a coincident,

31
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,480
# 最后这老佛爷的梦就圆了
Cixi’s dream comes true.

32
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,680
# 不就烧饼加肉 吗
So, just Shaobing and grounded meat. That’s pretty predictable.

33
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,840
# 不是加肉 哥
You would think, brother.

34
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,000
# 这叫圆梦烧饼
This is Cixi Shaobing.

35
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,520
# 圆梦圆了慈禧一个梦
This Shaobing brings Empress Dowager Cixi’s dream to life!

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
# 这是芯
This is the dough putting inside the wrapper.

37
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,320
# 芯里面还有油 对放点油
There is oil on the dough. Pour some oil.

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
# 空心烧饼就是
Oh so that creates the hollow effect for Shaobing

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,120
# 好加肉沫 加的肉沫多一些
Yes exactly. Much easier to add more grounded meat.

40
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,360
# 你看这
Look at this

41
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,520
# 干面点的就是不一样
That’s years of experience in Chinese pastry.

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
# 揪的匀啊
He can divide the dough so equally with just bare hands

43
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,440
# 好 和完了面
Ok, now we have the dough ready.

44
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
# 直接揪出来小芯 不用饧这个
Now we are making the smaller doughs to put inside. No need to proof them.

45
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,720
# 做完成品直接饧烧饼就行
Don’t proof it until finishing making the entire pastry dough.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
# 这放点油不粘
Add some oil so it won’t stick.

47
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,760
# 这芯好扣往外
In addition, we will find it easy to remove the inside dough after baking.

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
# 拿的时候好拿
Easy to remove.

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,960
# 这小活干的漂亮
That’s a neat skill!

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,720
# 蘸芝麻
Dip the dough into the sesame bowl on one side.

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,200
# 糖水容易粘 要是白水不行
But first we need to dip it into the sugar water (the plain water won’t work), so that the sesame will stay.

52
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,320
# 你看没有
Look

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
# 就这样就行了
This would work.

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,720
# 对
Yep

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,760
# 直接饧发就行
Then we can proof the doughs

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,360
# 亮子你发现没有
Liangzi, did you notice…

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,120
# 他这个酵母啊
That the quantity of the yeast…

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,560
# 来的大 酵母的量大
is large enough…

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,320
# 所以它就涨发
So that the dough rose well

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
# 一般都是5克
We usually use 5 g yeast

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
# 他加了8克
He used 8 g

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,320
# 他量加了 比原来更暄了
He used more so the dough comes out softer and ligher

63
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,560
# 好了
Ok

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,320
# 饧着吧 饧40分钟
Let the doughs proof for 40 min

65
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,080
# 就放这里面饧着
They can stay here

66
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
# 不能让它干了
We can’t let them dry

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
# 你看看这家庭这个多省事
See this is so convenient for DIY at your home kitchen

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,600
# 好了 烧饼发好了

# 放一会儿 烤箱先升上温

# 家庭的温度跟温度不一样
Everyone has a different oven

80
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
# 你可以看着它
You can check the dough out from time to time

# 炒不酥它不好吃
It’s not as tasty if you don’t fry it till crispy.

96

99
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,600
# 肥三瘦七 对 肥三瘦七

# 太肥了没法吃 腻得慌

# 太瘦了吧 它就发柴 没有香气
If the meat is too lean, it will be tough and lack of flavor

# 你是一个面团
The dough you used

159

# 你这面团是发面的
Is a leavened dough

00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
# 你应该做死面的
