00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,880

# 主要是让大家能在家能做

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,160

# 鲍鱼  这鲍鱼个儿不小

# Abalone, this one's got quite a size

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,960

# 活鲍鱼  这鲍鱼不便宜啊

# Live abalone, this could cost a fortune

49
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,920

# 不便宜  二十五

# Not cheap, 25 (per 500g)

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,960

# 洗鲍鱼呢 你看有层黑膜

# Washing abalone, you can see there's a black skin

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,080

# 弄点盐  淀粉

# Get some salt and starch

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,440

# 洗洗它的粘液  增白

# Wash off its slime and whitening it up

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,920

# 盐呢它去掉鲍鱼的粘液  也是去腥

# 宽细均匀你看看

# Look how they are evenly distributed

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440

# 深浅也合适  宝刀不老啊

# And the depth is appropriate as well, you are still good at it

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,240

# 鲍鱼处理完了啊

# We've finished with the abalones

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,000

# 您说说这海参  刚想起来

# Now lets talk about the sea cucumber just as I remembered

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,440

# 中国人讲究吃海参要吃刺参

# In China we prefer sea cucumbers with spikes

66
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,840

# 必须带刺

# Gotta have spikes

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920

# 要不带刺感觉就不像参似的

# It doesn't feel like sea cucumber without spikes

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,160

# 我们今天选这海参是

# These sea cucumbers we picked today are

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,120

# 葫芦岛野生六年的海参

# Six-year harvested from Hu Lu island

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,240

# 这还是即食的  开袋就可以加工

# And it's ready to eat, open the bag and you are ready to cook

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,400

# 我们稍微给它修整一下

# Let's trim it a little

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680

# 我们严格的说得用鸽蛋

# Strictly speaking we need to use pigeon eggs

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,760

# 今天咱们是用鹌鹑蛋

# But today we are using quail eggs

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,960

# 这是煮熟了的  剥好了皮儿

# Hard boiled and shells are removed

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,520

# 我们家里如果有条件可以买点

# If we can, it would be good to buy some

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,600

# 大的瑶柱啊  大干贝啊

# Large scallops and Conpoy

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,040

# 没有呢也没关系  其实现在也不贵

# If not, that's also ok. Plus its not expensive nowadays

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040

# 给老人做点好吃的  提什么贵啊

# Cooking for elderlies we don't talk about the price

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,000

# 佛跳墙关键的调味品在哪

# The key seasoning for this dish is

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,840

# 在这儿  哈哈  来啦

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080

# 黄酒

# Yellow wine

82
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,160

# 不管什么品牌的黄酒

# Doesn't matter which brand

83
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,880

# 做这个佛跳墙要用点好黄酒

# We have to use some decent yellow wine

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,560

# 没有好黄酒很本不叫佛跳墙

# Without decent yellow wine it can't even be called the buddha's temptation

85
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,440

# 在最初原始的佛跳墙

# The original version of this dish

86
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,240

# 其实都是以黄酒为主

# Was mainly cooked with yellow wine

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,560

# 你看这汤啊  把这个沫子要打干净

# Look at the broth, froth must be cleaned throughly

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,680

# 锅稍微小点啊

# This pot is a little small

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840

# 家里头不可能有那些顺手的家伙

# You can't always get those handy utilities at home

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,640

# 不是大点啦就是小点啦

# It's always too big or too small

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,480

# 但是我们把前期处理的事儿

# But we prepared it well enough

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760

# 给它弄好了

# Straighten it up

93
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,880

# 心 细  就能做到完美的结果

# With care you can achieve the perfect result

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,480

# 咱们选鸡得选什么样的鸡啊

# What type of chicken are we looking for

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320

# 一般的吊汤的鸡

# Normally speaking chicken used in making stock

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400

# 都是三年以上的老母鸡

# Must be hen aged over 3 years

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,360

# 找不出三年的啊  一年的行不行啊

# If we can't find over 3 years, would 1 year do?

98
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560

# 一年也行

# That will work

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720

# 拿温水洗  不能拿凉水

# Wash with warm water, not with cold water

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,520

# 凉水就给激回去了

# Cold water will shrink it back

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,680

# 另外凉水洗不干净

# Besides cold water can't wash it throughly

102
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,880

# 鸡油一招凉水就凝固了

# Chicken oil turns solid once washed with cold water

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,200

# 鸡头不要了啊

# Ditch the chicken head

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,680

# 还有一些浮在肉上的浮沫

# And some froth on the top

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,400

# 还是我在老饭骨前期节目说过的

# We've mentioned this in our previous videos

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,200

# 炖汤以前炖五六个小时

# We used to leave the stock on back burner for 5-6 hours

107
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,880

# 我感觉这里边的嘌呤还是不好的

# Now I feel like the purine in it is not so good for your health

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,600

# 因为在家里做饭么  要缩短时间

# Because we are cooking at home, we need to save time

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600

# 那就用高压锅

# We use a pressure cooker

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,200

# 但是我们在前期处理完了以后

# But only when we finished pre-processing the chicken

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600

# 才能用高压锅

# We can use pressure cooker

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560

# 这个汤你看没有沫子了

# Now you don't see any froth on the top

113
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,200

# 倒到这里头

# Pour it in here

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,560

115
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,360

# 扣上

# Put the lid on

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,160

# 五十分钟之后就OK了

# Let it sit for 50 mins

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600

# 那现在您干点什么啊

# What do you do now

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,160

# 现在这活儿接着就来啦

# Here it comes other jobs

# 先把这鲍鱼下去  小花让它开开

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,080

# Shrimps, abalones and sea cucumbers

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,040

# 还有鸽蛋

# pigeon eggs

142
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040

# 大爷说应该是鸽子蛋

# Da Ye says it should be pigeon eggs

143
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120

# 今天咱们是鹌鹑蛋

# Today we are using quail eggs

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880

# 咱们按实际的跟你们讲

# Let me tell you the truth

145
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920

# 看见没有

# Look

146
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,440

# 为什么把这鹌鹑蛋烫一下

# Why do I rinse the quail eggs with hot water

147
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,080

# 容易上色 你要冷的上不去

# For better colouring, you can't get the same colouring with cold eggs

148
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,680

# 老抽啊  这就是小点子大家别忘了

# And dark soy sauce, don't forget these tricks

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,120

# 这个以前师父没给我讲过啊

# My master had never mentioned these to me

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840

# 提意见了啊

# Someone has some complains

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,280

# 先给我来点油吧

# Give me some oil first

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,880

# 三叔啊  隋坡啊  看着

# San Shu and Sui Po look at this

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,960

# 上颜色了吧  你要如果说不加热

# Its getting some colour on it, if its not heated

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,240

# 这个鹌鹑蛋不加热

# If these quail eggs were not heated

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,840

# 这个老抽上不去

# The dark soy sauce won't get its colour on it

156
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,000

# 现在我们油也热了

# Now the oil is heated

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,480

# 我怎么不知道啊  你没跟三叔说啊

# How come I don't know about that, you never told San Shu.

158
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,800

# 不让您知道  你不用动勺了

# You don't have to know about this and don't have to worry about it

159
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,440

# 实际上就是过去我们

# Actually this is how we used to make

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,600

# 虎皮蛋烧肘子

# Hu Pi eggs with pork knuckles

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,440

# 把鸡蛋先炸一下  它炸出来香

# Deep fry the eggs to bring out the aroma

162
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,960

# 还有一师父讲过叫逢烧必炸

# And master once said "Feng Shao Bi Zha" (Must deep-fry if we need to shao )

163
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,720

# 逢烧必炸  用于吸味  差不多了啊

# It is used to absorb flavours

164
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,560

# 你看这小鸡蛋儿

# Check these tiny eggs

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,400

# 小鸡蛋（鹌鹑蛋）炸出来了啊

# Tiny eggs (quail eggs) are fried

166
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,320

# 咱们的汤也煲好了  大爷该动手了

# And our soup is done, it Da Ye's turn

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000

# 马上呈现出咱们最美好的

# We are about to present the best of

# 家庭版的佛跳墙

# Home style buddha's temptation

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,240

# 这小罐地道  佛跳墙

# This pot is really authentic

170
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160

# 家庭版的佛跳墙

# Home style buddha's temptation

171
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200

# 我们就得做到物尽其用

# We need to use everything to its last bit

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,720

# 佛跳墙里边也得搁点（肘子）

# Let's add some pork knuckle

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,800

# 又香  口感又烂糊

# Smells so good, with very tender and mushy texture

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360

# 我要是你我就不切了

# If I were you I wouldn't cut it

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,000

# 我就直接大块吃了

# I'd eat it straight up

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,520

# 把这肉垫在底下  再来点鸡块  鸡肉

# Put this at the bottom and add some chicken

177
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,880

# 你看 多么实惠

# Look how affordable this is

178
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920

# 搁点蘑菇  这叫什么菇啊

# Add some mushrooms, what are these

179
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,400

# 白玉菇  蟹腿菇

# Baiyu mushroom and crab leg mushroom

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400

# 把这个蘑菇出出水

# Let water come out of these mushrooms

181
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120

# 放点盐  进点小底味

# Add a bit of salt to set the base tone

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,000

# 来点鸡汤  鸡汤开始下了啊

# Some chicken broth, add some chicken broth

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,440

# 几勺啊  来两勺  给我来点老抽

# A few spoons of dark soy sauce

184
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,440

# 调点色  黄酒  把这蘑菇回锅

# Adjust the colour, yellow wine and add these mushrooms back in the wok

185
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,600

# 煨一下  搁点盐

# Let it bubble for a while and add some salt

186
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,560

# 您刚才是不搁过一次盐了么

# Haven't you already added once

187
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,000

# 那是搁水里边的

# That was into the water

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,080

# 这是搁什么里的  这是搁汤里的

# What is this for then? This is for the soup

189
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480

# 水和汤还是不一样

# Oh that's different

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880

# 搁点糖  中和了它的味道

# Add some sugar to balance the flavour

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360

# 这就好啦

# There we go

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,760

# 下边呢海参  鲍鱼一块煨

# At the bottom there are sea cucumbers and abalones being strewed together

193
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,320

# 虾球煨进去  鹌鹑蛋

# Shrimps and quail eggs

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:40,200

# 来点胡椒粉  胡椒粉啊

# Add a pinch of ground pepper

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,240

# 把这些东西都煨好了以后

# Once they are all cooked

196
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,400

# 我们开始往罐儿里摆放

# We place them into the pot

197
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,400

# 佛跳墙  先搁虾仁  垫下边

# For the buddha's temptation, shrimps go in first

198
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240

# 翠绿翠绿的小菜心

# Green bak-choy hearts

199
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,880

# 这汤没用了  我们还用鸡汤

# This is useless, we use chicken stock

200
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440

# 再调一汤  好

# Lets make another broth

201
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560

# 鸡汤里调点糖（和盐）

# Add some sugar and salt in the chicken stock

202
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680

# 因为咱们的佛跳墙

# Our dish can not be

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160

# 不能是愣咸愣咸的

# Simply salty taste

204
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,920

# 我们老饭骨又不搁鸡精味精的

# We don't use MSG or chicken powder

205
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,560

# 所以用糖来平衡味道

# So we use sugar to balance the taste

206
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,960

# 酒（黄酒）  酒一勺

# One spoon of yellow wine

207
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960

# 来点老抽

# A drizzle of dark soy sauce

208
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,320

# 原则上一般的不勾芡

# Normally we don't add starchy water

209
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,640

# 为什么呢  因为它有鹿筋呐

# Why? Because it has deers tendons

210
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,760

# 蹄筋啊  胶原蛋白比较多的

# Which contains plenty of collagen

211
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560

# 那就不勾芡

# Then we don't add starchy water

212
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,360

# 因为咱们今天做的是家庭版的

# Because we are making home style version

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,760

# 让它有浓厚的的味道

# To give it a thick taste

214
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,040

# 且今天的食材不用提前备

# Plus we don't need prepare much on the ingredients

215
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,040

# 满足我们想吃就吃的状态

# We can eat whenever we feel like

216
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,880

# 随时吃  这汁红亮

# Anytime, look at the sauce

217
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880

# 这粉劲儿有点小

# The starchy water don't thicken so well

218
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,400

# 一个方向转一转

# Stir in the same direction

219
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,000

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,680

# 走不叫走  走你  叫行

# Here we go

221
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,160

# 端得动么  倒了啊

# Can you hold it? I'm about to pour it

222
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,280

223
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,480

# 这都是好汤

# This is such a great broth

224
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,200

# 上锅吧  最好呢有个棉纸

# Put it on the stove, better have a cotton paper

225
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320

# 上头一盖  对一盖

# Cover the top up, right lid on

226
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,920

227
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,320

# 一小时了我给你掐着点儿呢

# One hour already I've been counting the time

228
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,800

# 忘了跟网友交代了

# Forgot to tell you all about this

229
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200

# 您为什么蒸一下

# Why to you steam it

230
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,400

# 实际上传统的佛跳墙要炖几个小时

# Normally it takes hours to make this dish

231
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,520

# 但是那都是属于干货涨发

# But that was to soak up these dried ingredients

232
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,760

# 就是那些海味品

# Those sea food

233
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,920

# 它那需要一个长时间的炖制

# It needs a long time on the stove

234
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,080

# 因为家庭版么  家庭条件有限

# Because it's home style and with limited equipment

235
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,640

# 有的用保鲜膜  保持这个酒的香味

# Some use cling wrap to keep the aroma of the wine

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160

# 看着就香啊  看着香吧

# It looks so delicious

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,680

# 那今天这罐正好够咱仨

# This pot is just the right amount for us three

238
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,560

# 咱们吃的时候别叫四弟

# Don't tell brother Is

239
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,240

# 谁也别叫  不许吭声  悄悄的

# Don't let him know, lets enjoy this behind his back

240
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,520

# 三叔尝尝  烫不烫啊  有点烫啊

# San she have a taste, is it hot? A little bit?

241
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,640

# 吹吹  怎么样  大爷

# Blow it a bit, how's it? Da Ye?

242
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,760

# 先甭说味儿  您这海参

# Beside the taste, just look at the sea cucumbers

243
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,320

# 前后掌握的火候特别好

# The cook time is managed really well

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,480

# 没有腥味吧  处理的好吧

# You don't taste any fishy smells right? It's cleaned so well

245
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,000

# 处理太好了  让我们徒弟尝尝

# It's done so well, let our apprentices to have a taste

246
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,440

# 你看看大爷就是大爷

# Look Da Ye is such a master

247
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,400

# 先紧着我们群众

# He holds us back

248
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,320

# 他能控制住情绪

# And controls the emotions

249
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,840

# 有人来了  听见有人来吧

# Someone's coming, I can hear the sound

250
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,960

# 快快这小伙子

# Quick quick young fella

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,600

# 哎呦大爷  我掐指一算

# Da Ye, I figured

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,120

# 录上录上

# Record that

253
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,600

# 我掐指一算我大爷这个佛跳墙出锅了

# I figured your buddha's temptation has came out of the pot

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,760

# 小焦来了  先给您请安

# Xiao Jiao has arrived, he greets you first

255
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,240

# 师侄来吧

# Master's nephew come

256
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,080

# 浓郁  唇齿留香

# Thick flavour and the taste lingers around your moth

257
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,880

# 匠心永不工业化

# Artisans spirits can never be industrialised

258
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,520

# 这真的是传承啊  匠心啊

# This is real inherit, artisans sprit

259
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,200

# 太厉害了  厉害吧

# 你们说的都是真的

# You are telling the truth
