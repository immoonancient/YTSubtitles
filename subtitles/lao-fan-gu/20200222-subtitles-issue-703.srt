40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
# 耗油的同时咱把口儿给它调出来
In the meantime we should start on the tofu

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
# 把雪里蕻加进去 豆儿

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,480
# 绿豆 先得泡 泡完以后打碎了
Mung, you have to soak it in water for about a day and crush using blender

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,600
# 糗出来的
you must "qiu"(put all the crushed mung in a container for a while and it becomes slimy) this tofu

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
# 它那个汁儿提出来
the liquid we obtained after that can be fermentated

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
# 发酵完了就是豆汁
and it becomes DouZhi(another Beijing traditional food)

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,880
# 渣子就是麻豆腐
the remaining is the Ma tofu

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,960
# 这个东西离不开黄酱 澥好的黄酱
Diluted Soybean sauce is a must for this dish

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
# 香啊是吧 层次感很强
Aromatic right? Strong layed scent

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,080
# 稍微提一点糖 糖提鲜 来一点
Give it a little sugar for it to be Xian(The fifth flavour that human can taste)

# 再切点葱末 没少用葱啊
chop more spring onions, we used a lot of onions

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
# 突出葱香味儿
to make the onion flavour stand out

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
# 看见没有网友 把炸好的葱切成末
Pay attention my friends, chop the fried onion into little chips

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,400
# 然后拌在里头吃着香
and mix it with the dish

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,880
# 下一个节目 豆汁
for our next trick, DouZhi!

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,960
# 用豆汁澥麻豆腐 原汁原味
we used Douzhi to dilute the Ma tofu as they are made of the same thing

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,000

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,600
# 香 酸香
Aromatic, It smells sour but aromatic(the smell of Douzhi)

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
# 咱们起锅坐油 关键是油
now we put a wok on the stove and pour in the oil

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
# 油可以多一点没关系 不要怕油大
we can use a little more oil, don't be afraid of using too much

63
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
# 既然做咱们就往传统上做
We will do it according to the tradition if we are to do this

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,440
# 想吃油少油多的自己去调整
You can adjust the amount of oil based on your own situation

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,960
# 再一次的大量的葱花 葱香味
LOTS OF ONION CHIPS!! The scent of onion

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,160
# 二十年专注京味菜
I've focused on Beijing cuisine for twenty years

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,000
# 讲究 香 离不开这香味
The scent of the dish had always played a big part in Beijing cuisine

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
# 有回味啊 改小火
There will be an after taste, turn down the gas

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
# 把麻豆腐下进去
shove the tofu in

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,840
# 跟炸酱面似的 待会弄碗面条得了
looks just like Zhajiang noodle's sauce, maybe make some noodles later

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,760
# 小火去推 必须得推
push it over a low flame

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,200
# 待会您看 这时候有油
You can see some oil floating

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
# 待会就没油了 全推进去了
and it will all be pushed into tofu a while later

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
# 小火慢慢熬 就跟炸酱似的
use a low flame just as you are making Zhajiang noodle's sauce

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,880
# 熬多长时间师父 一般
How long do we decoct it, master?

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,960
# 要如果有时间的话 四十分钟小火

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,640

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
# 多香 糗透了
The smell is so good, :3 we've almost done the "Qiuing"

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,440
# 您看没油了是吧三叔
See how there is no more oil seen now, Sanshu?

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,360
# 咱们现在基本上推了二十分钟了
We've pushed it for 20 mins now

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,720
# 待会往外噗噗冒气 气顶勺
There will me more steam over time

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,560
# 像我这样推四十分钟（更香了）
Push it for 40 mins will make it more aromatic

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
# 来欢子推会儿 徒弟推

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,440
# 就因为推麻豆腐推的
Because he push a lot of Ma tofu

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,120
# 还手工灌肠 外边都是自己买

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
# 我们都是自己做
but we make our own sausages

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,640
# 这麻豆腐不搁羊油不搁酱
if you don't make Ma tofu with mutton fat and soybean paste

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,080
# 出不来香味
there will not be enough scent

96
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,120
# 一般咱们家使的都是豆油是吧

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,480
# 关键是制料油跟葱油的时候
the crucial part is when you make the ani-oil and onion-oil

104
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,760
# 得制好了 一通百通
Have to make that right, and once you know the method there will be no strict rules when you cook

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,400
# 一看立住了
Look, it stands by itself

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
# 咱刨一个坑儿
we make a hole on top

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,760
# 你知道这刨坑儿还不能说
Don't talk about the hole!

111
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
# 待会他们就全看见了
They will see it later

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
# 韭菜越搁越多越香 韭菜不能少了

# 还是把辣椒洗一下
Let's wash the chilli first

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
# 洗一下油温高点没事
This way the oil temperture can be higher when "Zi" the spoon without overcooking the chilli

119
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
# 没问题
No Problem

120
