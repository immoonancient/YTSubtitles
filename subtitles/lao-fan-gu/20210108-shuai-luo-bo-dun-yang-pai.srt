# Hello friends! We are making stewed lamb ribs that you requested in the comment area for a long time!
# Today, Er Bai is taking over to teach you a tasty and nutritious dish: Smashed radish and lamb rib stew.
# For more details on making “instant” chicken broth, you could refer to 【State Banquet Ji Douhua (Chicken tofu pudding)】 Link: https://youtu.be/IKCLukES7-s
# Smashing the radish breaks its fiber, so it absorbs more flavour than just cutting it. At the end, we add some blanched cordyceps flower and goji berry to make it nutritious. It’s a great stew to have in winter!
