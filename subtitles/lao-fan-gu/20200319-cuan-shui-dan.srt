# 关于这汆水蛋的秘诀，二伯可是犹豫了半天要不要公布，小友们快来视频里找答案吧！
# Hello friends, today Er Bai brings us traditional Cuan Shui Dan from his grandama.
# This recipe is a heritage of Er Bai’s grandma. It looks simple but not easy. One tiny step missing then the whole flavor will be wrong. The ingredients are simple, using only Chinese Chives, eggs, soy sauce, MSG and sesame oil. However, the technique is tricky that the eggs are simmered, watch out for that, friends.
# About the secret recipe, Er Bai hesitated for a long time to announce it, come find the answer in the video, friends!

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
# 徒弟的味道做的还真不对
However, my disciples couldn’t get the flavor right.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,400
# 就简单东西

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,080
# 后来我告诉他细节在哪

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,400
# 你看见没有大爷 火咱先点上
Look,Da Ye. Frist we turn on the stove.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,640
# 把韭菜切的跟馅儿似的
Chop the chives like making stuffing.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,360

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,200
# 半斤韭菜 六个鸡蛋
250 grams of chives with six eggs.
