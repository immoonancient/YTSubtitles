# 国宴大师•鱼香蒸蛋】蒸蛋润、滑、嫩，精确到克的鱼香汁儿做法！一看就能学会！ |老饭骨

# State Banquet Master Chef – Steamed eggs Yuxiang Style

# 小友们好，二伯今天给大家带来一道家常美味——鱼香蒸蛋！
# 之前二伯做过鱼香肉丝，好多小友留言说想学鱼香汁儿但是味道把握不好，这不，这次咱们带来精确到克的量化版鱼香汁儿做法，包大家一学就会！
# 蒸蛋是每个家庭经常都会做的一道菜，蒸蛋怎么做才能润、滑、嫩，没有马蜂窝呢？小秘诀就是要加点盐、牛奶和温水，这样蛋液里面的筋才会断，更容易熟而且不起马蜂窝。
# 最后是我们量化过的鱼香汁儿配方，带给大家：绵白糖42克，米醋30克，黄酒15克，酱油23克，胡椒粉少许，水50克，豆瓣酱35克，泡椒15克，葱姜蒜少许，水淀粉适量。
# P.S上期视频已经收到小友们的反馈，这期已经调整了拍摄手法，大家伙儿请放心观看😁
