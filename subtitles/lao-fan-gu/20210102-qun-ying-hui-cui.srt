# 【国宴大师•群英荟萃】鲜香滋补，三种萝卜用最朴素的烹饪手法做出无比鲜美的味道！ |老饭骨
# State Banquet Master Chef: Qun Ying Hui Cui (Gathering of heroes)

# 简介

# 小友们好，今天咱们这个菜名可够别致的，叫——群英荟萃。看这五颜六色的，小友们能猜到主要的食材是什么吗？
# 没错，就是萝卜！俗话说得好，冬吃萝卜夏吃姜。萝卜营养丰富，含有多种维生素和大量植物蛋白等，经常吃萝卜有利于增强免疫力。
# 这道群英荟萃，选用了白萝卜、胡萝卜和青萝卜，颜色搭配好看，并且使用了淮阳菜的老菜扣三丝的手法，成菜更加精致。
# 搭配熬得奶白的鲫鱼汤，一口下去，无比鲜美！小友们家常吃也可以把萝卜丝儿直接煮到鲫鱼汤里，更加方便快捷！
# Hello friends! Today we are having a dish with a very special name: Qun Ying Hui Cui (Gathering of heroes). Looking at this colorful dish, can you figure out what the ingredients are?
# Yes, radish! As a saying goes, radish is for winter and ginger is for summer. Radish is very nutrient, containing various vitamins and rich plant proteins. Eating radish regularly is good for your immune system.
# For this dish, we use white radish, carrots, and green radish. Apart from its beautiful color, this dish is cooked in a delicate fashion - same as a traditional Huaiyang dish, Kou San Si (steamed three shreds).
# This dish is incomparably delicious with the milky-white carp soup. When cooking at home, you may also boil the shredded radish in the carp soup, making it simple and fast!
