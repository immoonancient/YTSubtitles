00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,080

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
# 鸭子的肛门处（清理干净）
Clean up the anal area of the duck

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,440
# 这边呢 鸭骚
Here, (remove) the preen gland 

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,960
# 可骚了这个 可有味了
This smells really bad. It will produce a terrible flavor

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,080
# 我看有舌头没有 没有
Let me check if the tongue is still there

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,320
# 这很关键啊
This is really important

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,440
# 大爷能给您舌头么
Da Ye, it's not possible that they keep the tongue

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
# 那舌头贵着呢
Tongues are expensive

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,200
# 那舌头早卖钱去了
They must have sold it

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,680
# 这里有根管 食管
Here's a tube. The gullet

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
# 得把管给抽出来
We need to pull it out

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
# 看啊 关键这点的啊
Look. This is important

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,080
# 挤出来可都是脏东西
I am squeezing out the dirty stuff

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,400
# 这鸭子里边大脏鼻涕
The dirty snot in the duck

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,760
# 把这鸭子好好的洗一洗
Wash the duck thoroughly

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
# 你看这水 倍儿脏
Look. The water is pretty dirty

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,080

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,840
# 这鸭子在做之前首先得腌
Before cooking, we need to marinate the duck

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,240
# 用盐要搓洗
Rub it with salt

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,000
# 腿 肚皮里边
Legs. Inside the abdominal cavity

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,240
# 拿手（抹匀）让它便于入味
Spread the salt with your hands to let flavor penetrate

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,120
# 第二步搁香料
Second, add the spices

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,600
# 大料 花椒 小茴香（桂皮）
Star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, fennel seed (and cinnamon)

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,000
# 料酒 姜葱来点
Chinese cooking wine, and some ginger and green onion

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,880
# 腌的时候我们腌两个小时
Marinate the duck for 2 hours

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,440
# 因为鸭子大 得入味
Because this is a big duck. We need to wait for the flavor penetration

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,640
# 我们时不时就要给它翻一翻
Flip the duck from time to time

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,160
# 今天咱采取煮的办法
Today we will boil the duck

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,640
# 因为咱家没有那么大的蒸锅
Because we don't have a steaming pot that's big enough

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,000
# 这个先腌一会儿
Let's marinate it for now

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,080
# 待会儿咱们给它煮上
We'll boil it later

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
# 借这个机会咱们备点料
At this time, prepare some other ingredients

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,640
# 炒点花椒 晾一晾
Stir-fry some Sichuan peppercorns, then cool them

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,800
# 这个桃仁我们要在处理的时候
The walnut kernels... when processing it

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
# 要拿水泡 开水泡
You need to soak it with boiling water

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,080
# 拿牙签把皮给扒下去
Then remove the skin with a toothpick

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,920
# 要不然它就涩苦
Otherwise it's gonna taste bitter

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,680
# 这油温别太大
Don't use very high oil temperature

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,680
# 这一定要用老桃仁 老桃仁香
You must use ripe walnut kernels. They're more aromatic

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
# 差不多了 尽快的离开油
That's almost done. Pick it out from the oil asap

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
# 为什么要早炸啊
Why frying it prior to cooking the duck?

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
# 早炸得让它晾凉了 它脆
We need to cool it down such that it becomes crispy

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,600
# 好了 鸭子够时间了
Okay. The duck is done

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,320
# 这个水里边有葱姜 黄酒 盐
There're ginger, green onion, Huangjiu cooking wine, and salt

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,280
# 盖盖儿
Put the lid on

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
# 三十五分钟
35 minutes

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
# 大爷今儿这个菜都费劲的菜
Da Ye is preparing some really complicated dishes today

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,360
# 擀面杖来了
Here's the rolling pin

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,440
# 你看这花椒 现在非常酥是吧
Look at the Sichuan peppercorns. Very crispy now, right?

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,160
# 在过去 因为在酒店上班
In the past, I was working in restaurants

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
# 这鸭子不能带骨头
The duck must be served without bones

53
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,080
# 那就好好把这鸭子去骨
So I needed to debone the duck carefully

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,120
# 去骨这肉少了
However, that'll remove some meat as well

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,080
# 肉少了拿虾找补
So we compensate with shrimp

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,640
# 弄点馅给它一瓤
Prepare some mashed shrimp as the stuffing

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
# 吃起来又方便
That's also convenient to eat

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,200
# 最好吃的还就是虾
Shrimp is the most delicious food

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,240
# 你看这个是小窍门啊
This is a trick

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,680
# 找葱芯 为什么啊
Use the core of the green onion

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,600
# 你看这葱芯肉厚水分足
The green onion core is thick and full of moisture

62
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
# 这是我师父
This is a small trick

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,240
# 教给我这么一个小绝招
taught by my master

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
# 李党为什么说你来着了呢
Li Dang, your trip here is worth it

65
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,960
# 把花椒面和葱混到一起
Mix the Sichuan peppercorn powder with the minced green onion

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
# 加上盐 葱椒盐
Then add some salt. That's onion-pepper-salt

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,160
# 你看二伯
Hey, Er Bai

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
# 二伯一看就有丰富的经验
Er Bai is very experienced

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
# 二伯您回答非常正确啊
Er Bai is absolutely right

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,880
# 得到你表扬真不容易
It's difficult to be praised by you

71
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
# 我从来不表扬人
I hardly ever praise people

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,160
# 您一下就说对了
but you got it right immediately

73
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,400
# 你要让李党说李党都说不出来
Li Dang cannot answer this question

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
# 说不出来 真说不出来
No, I cannot... Seriously

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
# 这就是比椒盐好吃啊 香啊
This is definitely better than pepper-salt. It's more aromatic

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
# 特别香这个
Extremely aromatic

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
# 这解决什么问题呢
How does it work?

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,920
# 比如香酥鸡 香酥鸭
Say, when cooking fried crispy chicken or duck

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,960
# 有时候这底味 味道不足
The base flavor is not strong enough sometimes

80
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,240
# 原料底下给抹点葱椒盐
In this case, spread some onion-pepper-salt underneath the meat

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,000
# 这就是师父的绝招在这
That's a great trick from your master

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
# 而且刚才一剁
Also, as we just chopped it

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,720
# 花椒的香味跟葱的鲜味
The aromas of peppercorns and green onion...

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
# 马上就产生出来了
are activated immediately

85
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,600
# 而且那鸭子出来味道就不一样了
The duck will also taste differently after cooking

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,040
# 你看这刚才准备的
Look. This is what we just prepared

87
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
# 肥膘肉切碎
Minced pork fat

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,280
# 虾馅 一斤虾肉要搁
Mashed shrimp stuffing. In 500 grams of shrimp,

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
# 二两五左右的肥膘肉
We add about 125 g of pork fat

90
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,840
# 葱姜 搁点酒 这叫什么
Green onion, ginger, and some cooking wine. What's this?

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,920
# 葱姜酒水
green onion-ginger-wine

92
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,840
# 倒这虾胶里头
Pour it into the shrimp stuffing

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,440
# 淀粉 盐
Starch and salt

94
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
# 白胡椒粉 去腥的啊
White pepper powder. This removes the fishy odor

95
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,400
# 蛋清也别太多 一半就够了
Don't add too much egg white. Just a half would be enough

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,280
# 料都放齐了 抓匀搅拌上劲
That's all the ingredients. Mix until it becomes sticky

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,640
# 这虾胶打的还真是腻乎啊
The shrimp stuffing is indeed quite sticky

98
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,080
# 好 有劲儿了
Okay. Now it's sticky enough

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,640
# 咱就等鸭子了啊 好嘞
Let's wait for the duck to be done

100
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
# 走
Pick it out

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
# 咱们这鸭子晾凉了
After cooling the duck

102
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,400
# 晾凉了咱们给它把骨头拆了
Let's remove the bones

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,960

104
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,160
# 拆骨的时候脯朝下
When deboning, the duck breast should be put towards the chopping board

105
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
# 拆出来是整个的
In that case, you'll have a complete duck at last

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,160

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,280
# 我们这拆骨要拆净它
We need to remove the bones completely

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,480

109
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,800
# 好了 行
Ok. It's done

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,280
# 撒点淀粉就行 粘上它
Sprinkle some starch. Let it stick to the duck

111
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,920
# 它一炸能托一下
When frying, it's gonna hold the duck together

112
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,160
# 因为这刚做的鸭子
The duck is freshly made

113
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,600
# 一会炸的时候表面好酥脆
Hence the surface is gonna be crispy after frying

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,640
# 倒油 烧上了啊
Add some oil. Heating now

115
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,640
# 葱椒盐 铺上了
Green onion-pepper-salt. Spread on the duck

116
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,560
# 铺上了要拍淀粉
After that, pat some starch on the duck

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
# 这鸭子是新煮的
The duck is freshly boiled 

118
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,120
# 淀粉要稍微多一点
Hence we need to use more starch

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,040
# 连拍带弹 定型了啊
Pat it to fix the shape

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,200
# 这样炸出来它不掉它不散了
Then it's not gonna fall apart when frying

121
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
# 这会咱们就开始往上抹馅了
Let's apply the stuffing now

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
# 我们厨师啊
As a chef

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,640
# 不单单是会做菜
Cooking is not our only profession

125
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,840
# 还要会瓦匠
We need to be bricklayers sometimes

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,840
# 要会抹 抹平
You should be able to spread it evenly

128
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,080
# 薄厚要均匀 好了
The thickness should be even. That's done

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,880
# 还一个关键点
One more important trick

130
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,800

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,880
# 让它彻底馅和鸭肉融为一体
is to fuse the stuffing with the duck completely

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
# 师父这叫什么
What's this trick, master?

133
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,760
# 这叫瓤 瓤馅儿么
This is called 'rang'. 'Rang' the stuffing

134
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,520
# 轻轻的排一下 然后再给抹平了
Cut it gently. Then flatten the surface again

135
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
# 这就是师父的绝招啊
That's a secret trick from your master

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,720
# 这就是烹饪中的技巧
A trick in cooking

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
# 桃仁 这样你粘完之后
The walnut kernel. In this way,

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,360
# 打死它都不会脱了
The stuffing will never fall from the duck

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,720
# 桃仁排队了啊
That's walnut kernels lining up

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040

141
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,960
# 一推齐活 一道大菜
Press it, done! A 'big' dish

142
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,880
# 往那一出溜 油温六成热
Slide it into the wok. The oil temperature is 180 degrees Celsius

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,480
# 这油温也不能太高 也不能太凉
It shouldn't be too high, nor too low

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,720
# 定型的时候就得高点 先定
When fixing the shape, you need to use a higher oil temperature

145
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,480

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,120
# 融为一个整体了吧
That's fusing together

147
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,120
# 鼓起来了 鼓起就熟了
It's swelling up. That's done

148
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,760

149
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,960
# 桃仁酥鸭方 好了
