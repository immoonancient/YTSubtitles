# State Banquet Master Chef - Candied hawthorn. Sweet and sour. Delicious appetizer.


# Hello friends, it’s Monday, Lao Fangu brings everyone a childhood memory -Bingtang Hulu (Candied hawthorn)!
# Bingtang Hulu is sweet and sour, suitable for all ages. It also has the effects of appetizing, beautifying, enhancing intelligence, eliminating fatigue, and clearing heat, etc. that everyone may not think of.
# Bingtang Hulu is actually very simple to make. Following the three key steps demonstrated by Master Wei, the sugar coating can be made thin and crispy without sticking to the teeth.
# Making this snack, Da Ye and Er Bai feel a bit sad and nostalgia. It brings back their childhood memory. Usually when they had their skewered candied hawthorn, Chinese New Year was around the corner. Decades have passed since then.
# Friends, do you have any snacks from childhood memories that you want to eat? Tell us in the comment section. We will make it for you!

# 这个是网友盼了已久已久了
Our viewers have been waiting a long, long time for this one

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,800
# 这是刚才洗了一遍水
We’ve just washed it with water

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,240
# 咱们现在处理一下 加点盐
Now we will start to prepare it. First we add salt

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,000
# 把这脏东西都处理掉
This cleans away any remaining dirt

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,520
# 再加上底口有点盐度
and adds a bit of saltiness

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,560
# 这样它不腻口了
so it’s not too sweet

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,040
# 要想甜 加点盐
If you want it sweet, you’ve got to add salt

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,680

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,360
# 控下水
Drain the water

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,040
# 糖葫芦也是庙会上的
Candied hawthorn is something

17
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,280
# 不可缺少的一个美食
that can not be lacked of in a temple fair 

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,880
# 这糖葫芦 又简单又不简单
It’s so simple yet so hard to get right

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
# 其实关键是炒糖
The key to it is in cooking the caramel

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,760
# 炒过了呢就苦了
Overcook makes it too bitter

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,160
# 炒的不够呢 粘牙
Undercook makes it too sticky to the teeth

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,800
# 你把这难度说的这么大
You make a big deal of how difficult this is

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,960
# 就说明自己的技术高超啊这意思
Are you trying to demonstrate how skilful you are?

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
# 在师父跟大爷面前
Next to Master and Da Ye…

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
# 还是心里
I still feel a little

26
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
# 还是有点那什么
You know…

27
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,320
# 不是 师父还是厉害
Master is still the best

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,200
# 下次让二伯做一个 那叫翻砂的
Next time we should let Er Bai do a sugar coated dish

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,360
# 那个是我强项
That one’s my specialty

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,480
# 过去我老做翻砂芋头 老粤菜
In the past, I would always be making sugar coated taro  -  an old Cantonese dish

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,440
# 炒出来特别好吃 是吧
I can make that one real good  -  oh really?

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,840
# 下次您来一个吧
We’ll get you to do it next time then

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,120
# 糖葫芦串好了
The skewers are all ready to go now

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,880
# 往这一摆跟那小算盘似的
Place them like this and it looks just like an abacus

35
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,200
# 开始熬糖
Now we can start cooking the sugar

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,000
# 260克水
260g of water

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,440
# 300克白砂糖
300g of white sugar

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,040
# 水炒 纯水炒
We will be using water to cook the sugar, water and nothing else

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
# 这刚开始大火
Use high heat at the beginning

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,280
# 待会快好的时候开始就小火了
We let it heat up first and turn it back down to low when it’s almost ready

42
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,520
# 抹点油这上头
Rub some oil here

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
# 待会不容易粘上 不容易粘
to prevent the sugar from sticking later on

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
# 这时候咱们稍微加一点点盐
Now add a small pinch of salt

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
# 吃到嘴里它不腻
so it’s not overly sweet

46
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,680
# 这个原来小的时候来这么一串
Back when we were kids, you would count yourself lucky

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,880
# 算是好生活了 是吧大爷
just to eat even one of these  -  isn’t that right, Da Ye?

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,240
# 很奢侈了
Luxurious is what it’d be

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,640
# 小时候小孩没那么多零食
Back in our days, kids didn’t have that many snacks

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,320
# 炒这糖色待会儿会有三个步骤
When caramelising the sugar, there are three main steps

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,000
# 第一个步骤 就是冒白泡
The first step is let the bubbles form

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,360
# 你看这会儿的糖 这个泡是白的
Look at how the sugar is here, the bubbles are white

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,560
# 再炒一会 晾凉了以后
If you keep cooking, after it has cooled and dried

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,400
# 就可以做成翻砂了
you can use it as a sugar coating

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
# 炒糖色不能着急
When caramelising sugar it’s important not to rush, you’ve got to be patient with it

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
# 还是大火 慢慢炒
It’s still on high heat  -  let it continue to caramelise slowly

57
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,680
# 这会有点上色了
You can see it’s starting to get a bit of colour

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,960
# 大爷现在就可以翻砂了
Da Ye could use this as sugar coating when it’s at this stage

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
# 这时候就得转小火了
We turn the heat down to low

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,200
# 第二个步骤
The second step

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
# 这糖深黄色的时候
When the caramel has taken on a dark yellow colour

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
# 再炒一会就可以拔丝了
keep cooking a bit longer and it will be ready for use as a sugar glaze

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
# 拔丝就蘸糖葫芦没问题了
This glaze will have no problem sticking to the hawthorn

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,480
# 然后这稠度一下来 稀释了
When it has reached this consistency, the water starts to take on the sugar

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,200
# 花泡一下去就能拔丝了
Keep stirring for a while longer and it’ll be ready for use

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
# 把火关了啊
Turn the heat off

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,280
# 离火 离下来
and take it off the hob

68
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,080
# 这时候你看 这糖色
Have a look at this colour

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
# 这时候拔丝好 金黄色
You know it’s ready when you see this golden hue

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
# 稀了你看见没有 这就行了
See how clear it is now

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,440
# 这时候可以挂了啊 挂糖了
We can now start glazing

72
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
# 薄薄的一层
a thin layer like this

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,400

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
# 速度要快
You’ve got to move quick for this step

75
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800

76
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
# 好 齐活
Alright! It’s all ready

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,280
# 冰糖葫芦
Candied hawthorn

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,960
# 剩下这糖 我加点水
With the leftover glaze, we add some water

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
# 这会儿就糖色了
and we’re left with some caramelised sugar

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
# 炖个肉啊 炖个排骨
This is good to braise meat with like spare ribs

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,160
# 一举两得了啊 好嘞
Two birds with one stone

82
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,680
# 师父尝尝
Master, have a taste

83
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,320

84
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,040
# 听声音
Listen to that sound

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,560

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
# 嘎嘣脆
It has that crackling crispy sound

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,680
# 慢点 别把核当冰糖咬了
Slow down there, you’re going to end up chewing on the core

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
# 大爷咱们小时候
When we were young

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
# 要吃这么一串糖葫芦过年了
If you wanted to eat this, we’d have to wait for Chinese New Year

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
# 一想40多年过去了大爷
Thinking about it now, it must be around 40 years now right Da Ye?

91
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,640
# 多少看见糖葫芦有点伤悲
Seeing these makes me a bit sad

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,320
# 我有30年
Its been 30 years for me

93
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
# 没吃过糖葫芦了
since I last ate this

94
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
# 真像二伯说的
It’s just like Er Bai says

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,040
# 我们想起了儿时的记忆
When we think back to our childhood

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,680
# 鼓励的话 二伯也说了 我也说了
Alright, Er Bai and I have both said words of encouragement

97
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,960
# 再说一个不足的地儿
Now lets talk about ways we could improve this

98
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,720
# 我见人家蘸糖葫芦
I saw someone making this once

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,240
# 其实蘸我们这大理石板上
but they were using a marble board

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,000
# 一定要有一个什么厚一点的石头板
It’s best to use a thicker stone board

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,720
# 外边晾一下 给它冻一下
then if you dry the surface and freeze it

102
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
# 或者让它镇凉一点
or press something cold against it

103
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
# 你这个糖往上一浇 唰一流
When the glaze falls off it

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,600
# 正好冰花出来 更精彩
it freezes and creates beautiful ice crystals

105
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,040
# 然后还有一点不足大爷
and there’s still one last thing, Da Ye

106
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,080
# 说说说 抢答了
Go on， over to you

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,440
# 我跟你说做这个
When you making this dish

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,120
# 核必须得去
it’s best to remove the core

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,160
# 要不然你让我们吐核多难受啊
otherwise people have to keep spitting it out, not the best eating experience, you know?

110
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,520
# 这必须得改
You’re not wrong, it’s much better to do it that way

111
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,680
# 好 感谢师父 感谢大爷 好
Alright, thank you Master. Thank you Da Ye
