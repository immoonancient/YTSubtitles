# 往这一摆
Place them like this

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,520
# 跟那个小算盘似的
and it looks just like an abacus

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,720
# 挂糖了
Pour the sugar over

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,440
# 薄薄的一层
to create a thin layer

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,000
# 糖是嘎嘣脆
and that crackling crispy sound

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
# 冰糖葫芦
Candied hawthorn

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,360
# 这个是网友盼了已久已久了
Our viewers have been waiting a long, long time for this one

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,800
# 这是刚才洗了一遍水
We’ve just washed it with water

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,240
# 咱们现在处理一下 加点盐
Now we will start to prepare it. First we add salt

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,000
# 把这脏东西都处理掉
This cleans away any remaining dirt

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,520
# 再加上底口有点盐度
and adds a bit of saltiness

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,560
# 这样它不腻口了
so it’s not too sweet

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,040
# 要想甜 加点盐
If you want it sweet, you’ve got to add salt

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,680

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,360
# 控下水
Drain the water

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,040
# 糖葫芦也是庙会上的
Candied hawthorn is something

17
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,280
# 不可缺少的一个美食
no temple fair can be without

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,880
# 这糖葫芦 又简单又不简单
It’s so simple yet so hard to get right

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
# 其实关键是炒糖
The key to it is in cooking the caramel

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,760
# 炒过了呢就苦了
Overcook it and it turns bitter

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,160
# 炒的不够呢 粘牙
Undercook it and it sticks to the teeth

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,800
# 你把这难度说的这么大
You make a big deal of how difficult this is

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,960
# 就说明自己的技术高超啊这意思
Are you trying to demonstrate how skilful you are?

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
# 在师父跟大爷面前
Next to Master and Da Ye…

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
# 还是心里
I still feel a little

26
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
# 还是有点那什么
You know…

27
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,320
# 不是 师父还是厉害
Master is still the best

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,200
# 下次让二伯做一个 那叫翻砂的
Next time we should get Er Bai to do that sugar coated dish

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,360
# 那个是我强项
That one’s my specialty

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,480
# 过去我老做翻砂芋头 老粤菜
In the past, I would always be making sugar coated taro  -  an old Cantonese dish

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,440
# 炒出来特别好吃 是吧
I can make that one real good  -  oh really?

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,840
# 下次您来一个吧
We’ll get you to do it next time then

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,120
# 糖葫芦串好了
The skewers are all ready to go now

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,880
# 往这一摆跟那小算盘似的
Place them like this and it looks just like an abacus

35
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,200
# 开始熬糖
Now we can start cooking the sugar

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,000
# 260克水
260g of water

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,440
# 300克白砂糖
300g of white sugar

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,040
# 水炒 纯水炒
We will be using water to cook the sugar, water and nothing else

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
# 这刚开始大火
It’s just been put on high heat

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,280
# 待会快好的时候开始就小火了
We let it heat up first and turn it back down to low when it’s almost ready

42
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,520
# 抹点油这上头
Rub some oil here

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
# 待会不容易粘上 不容易粘
to prevent the sugar from sticking later on

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
# 这时候咱们稍微加一点点盐
Now add a small pinch of salt

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
# 吃到嘴里它不腻
so it’s not overly sweet

46
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,680
# 这个原来小的时候来这么一串
Back when we were kids, you would count yourself lucky

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,880
# 算是好生活了 是吧大爷
just to eat even one of these  -  isn’t that right, Da Ye?

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,240
# 很奢侈了
Luxurious is what it’d be

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,640
# 小时候小孩没那么多零食
Back in our days, kids didn’t have that many snacks

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,320
# 炒这糖色待会儿会有三个步骤
When caramelising the sugar, there are three main steps

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,000
# 第一个步骤 就是冒白泡
The first step is let the bubbles form

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,360
# 你看这会儿的糖 这个泡是白的
Look at how the sugar is here, the bubbles are white

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,560
# 再炒一会 晾凉了以后
If you keep cooking, after it has cooled and dried

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,400
# 就可以做成翻砂了
you can use it as a sugar coating

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
# 炒糖色不能着急
When caramelising sugar it’s important not to rush, you’ve got to be patient with it

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
# 还是大火 慢慢炒
It’s still on high heat  -  let it continue to caramelise slowly

57
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,680
# 这会有点上色了
You can see it’s starting to get a bit of colour

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,960
# 大爷现在就可以翻砂了
Da Ye could use this as sugar coating when it’s at this stage

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
# 这时候就得转小火了
We turn the heat down to low

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,200
# 第二个步骤
The second step

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
# 这糖深黄色的时候
When the caramel has taken on a dark yellow colour

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
# 再炒一会就可以拔丝了
keep cooking a bit longer and it will be ready for use as a sugar glaze

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
# 拔丝就蘸糖葫芦没问题了
This glaze will have no problem sticking to the hawthorn

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,480
# 然后这稠度一下来 稀释了
When it has reached this consistency, the water starts to take on the sugar

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,200
# 花泡一下去就能拔丝了
Keep stirring for a while longer and it’ll be ready for use

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
# 把火关了啊
Turn the heat off

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,280
# 离火 离下来
and take it off the hob

68
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,080
# 这时候你看 这糖色
Have a look at this colour

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
# 这时候拔丝好 金黄色
You know it’s ready when you see this golden hue

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
# 稀了你看见没有 这就行了
See how clear it is now

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,440
# 这时候可以挂了啊 挂糖了
We can now start glazing

72
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
# 薄薄的一层
a thin layer like this

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,400

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
# 速度要快
You’ve got to move quick for this step

75
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800

76
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
# 好 齐活
Alright! It’s all ready

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,280
# 冰糖葫芦
Candied hawthorn

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,960
# 剩下这糖 我加点水
With the leftover glaze, we add some water

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
# 这会儿就糖色了
and we’re left with some caramelised sugar

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
# 炖个肉啊 炖个排骨
This is good to braise meat with like spare ribs

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,160
# 一举两得了啊 好嘞
Two birds with one stone

82
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,680
# 师父尝尝
Master, have a taste

83
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,320

84
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,040
# 听声音
Listen to that sound

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,560

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
# 嘎嘣脆
It has that crackling crispy sound

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,680
# 慢点 别把核当冰糖咬了
Slow down there, you’re going to end up chewing on the core

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
# 大爷咱们小时候
When we were young

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
# 要吃这么一串糖葫芦过年了
If you wanted to eat this, we’d have to wait for Chinese New Year

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
# 一想40多年过去了大爷
Thinking about it now, it must be around 40 years now right Da Ye?

91
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,640
# 多少看见糖葫芦有点伤悲
How many of these have I seen since then? Makes me a bit sad

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,320
# 我有30年
Its been 30 years for me

93
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
# 没吃过糖葫芦了
since I last ate this

94
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
# 真像二伯说的
It’s just like Er Bai says

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,040
# 我们想起了儿时的记忆
When we think back to our childhood

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,680
# 鼓励的话 二伯也说了 我也说了
Alright, Er Bai and I have both said words of encouragement

97
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,960
# 再说一个不足的地儿
Now lets talk about ways we could improve this

98
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,720
# 我见人家蘸糖葫芦
I saw someone making this once

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,240
# 其实蘸我们这大理石板上
but they were using a marble board

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,000
# 一定要有一个什么厚一点的石头板
It’s best to use a thicker stone board

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,720
# 外边晾一下 给它冻一下
then if you dry the surface and freeze it

102
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
# 或者让它镇凉一点
or press something cold against it

103
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
# 你这个糖往上一浇 唰一流
When the glaze falls off it

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,600
# 正好冰花出来 更精彩
it freezes and creates beautiful ice crystals

105
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,040
# 然后还有一点不足大爷
and there’s still one last thing, Da Ye

106
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,080
# 说说说 抢答了
Go on， over to you

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,440
# 我跟你说做这个
When you making this dish

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,120
# 核必须得去
it’s best to remove the core

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,160
# 要不然你让我们吐核多难受啊
otherwise people have to keep spitting it out, not the best eating experience, you know?

110
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,520
# 这必须得改
You’re not wrong, it’s much better to do it that way

111
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,680
# 好 感谢师父 感谢大爷 好
Alright, thank you Master. Thank you Da Ye
