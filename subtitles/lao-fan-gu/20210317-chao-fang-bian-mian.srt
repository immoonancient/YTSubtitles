# [State banquet chefs – stir fried instant noodles]

# 小友们好，今天大爷给大家伙儿带来一个方便面更加健康的吃法，炒方便面！

# Today, Da Ye will show you a healthier way of cooking instant noodles-stir fry them!

# 大爷和二伯知道很多小友工作都特别辛苦，很多时候劳累了一天到家，可能就凑合吃碗泡面了，为了让大家伙吃得更加健康营养，大爷总结出了一个炒方便面的做法！
# 做方便面最好要用煮的，不要泡，这样更利于消化，吃起来口感也更好。而且煮泡面尽量都煮两遍，第一遍的水不要，这样会更健康。

# Using simmered instant noodles rather than soaked ones. This way, they taste better and easy to digest. Additionally, the noodles are better boiled twice to ensure healthier eating habit.

# 炒方便面的配料我们用了豆芽、韭菜、胡萝卜丝、洋葱、木耳、鸡蛋，做出来的方便面食材丰富、颜色五彩缤纷还更有营养！

# Additional ingredients are bean sprouts, Chinese chives, shredded carrots, onion, black fungus and eggs.

# 这样的方便面做法简单快捷、经济实惠，希望大家伙在努力工作之余也别忘了要好好吃饭哦！最后片尾还有大爷二伯快问快答时间，不要忘了收看~
