今天咱们是来吃面的
We’re going to have noodles here

他们告诉我 是六点开门
I was told that it opens at 6am

但是现在你看
But now as you see...

排队了
THERE IS A LINE

我还打算吃今天的头一锅呢
I thought I could have the first bowl of the day

（亲贤打卤面）
(Qinxian Dalu Noodles)

（乖乖排队吧）
(Getting in line..)

（等到六点再开锅）
(Waiting till 6am to start)

（潇洒）
(Easy!)

（大碗10块 中碗9块 小碗8块）
(Large - 10RMB  Medium - 9RMB  Small - 8RMB)

（你好 一个大碗两个鸡蛋）
(Excuse me, can I have a large bowl of noodle with two egg?)

（一个大碗面）
（大碗？）
（一个大碗三个鸡蛋）
(Can I have a large one?)
(Large?)
(Large, with 3 eggs)

咱来的时候不到六点钟
We arrived before 6am

但是每个桌都被占了
but every table was occupied

很多人 人没有在桌子旁
There were many people who were not present

但是把蒜 小菜放在桌上占位置
Instead, they put their appetizers and garlic on the tables to claim occupancy

已经都占满了
So all tables were occupied

（像这个样子 第一批顾客吃完了我才找到位置）
(Like this. I got a table after the first customers were done.)

打卤面 下面是面条
This is “Dalu” noodle. Noodles are put at the bottom

卤子是现放上去的
and then there’s some “Luzi” toppings

上面飘了一层的韭菜
And there’s a lot of chopped Chinese chives floating

这个打卤面卤子比面还要多
There’s actually more “Luzi” toppings than noodles

看 这里面放的是香菇木耳还有肉
Look, there’s shiitake, wood ear and meat

此外呢 还有鸡蛋腐竹这些
and also eggs and tofu skin

看起来汤汁很浓郁
The sauce looks really thick

这个面条虽然说看起来还有点不规则
The noodles look slightly irregular

但是吃起来很劲道
but it’s really chewy

弹滑
Chewy and smooth

卤子直接吃是有点咸的
The “Luzi” topping is a little salty if you eat it directly

吃起来有姜末和胡椒粉的辣味
There’s a little spiciness of ground ginger and pepper inside

（辛辣的味道）
(The spiciness)

吃面的时候 顺带吃卤子
So if you eat the noodles and “Luzi” toppings together

就会觉得味道刚刚好
the taste is just right

它里面放的是生韭菜 你越吃越鲜
And there’s raw Chinese chive inside. The umami level goes up as you eat it.

卤子是越吃越稀的 到最后也没有那么咸了
The taste of the Luzi gets less and less strong, and in the end it’s not that salty

很多人就直接喝了它
Then many people just drink it directly
