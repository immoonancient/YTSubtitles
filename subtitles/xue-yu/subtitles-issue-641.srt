# 标题：广东炖汤架势真大！40个大煲塞满料，3小时不停火，闻味就想喝
# Various Soups served in large pots in Guangdong! Aromatic and delicious!
# 简介：“宁可食无肉，不可食无汤”，这次终于能来来广东喝汤了。去的地方是佛山一家农汤老店，这里是用瓦罐来煲汤，他们会根据不同时节变化汤里的食材，应时喝汤，并且汤都不会是很重的味道。每一煲汤都是在炭火炉子上熬制的，3个小时不停火才能熬制出来，里面的各种食材都被炖得很烂乎，汤色奶白，喝起来鲜香甜口，让人回味无穷。
# There is a saying that you can have a meal without meat but soup is essential. We are finally in Guangdong to enjoy soups, the restaurant has been operated for years in Foshan and they cook soups using clay pots. The owner will change their soup ingredients seasonally and the soups taste refreshing. They cook their soups with charcoal for three hours, the ingredients become tender and mushy, the soups are cloudy, sweet and full of umami flavour.
