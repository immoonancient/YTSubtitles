# 广西柳州螺蛳粉，一碗7元，酸辣口味忘不了！再加6大盆的猪蹄鸡脚牛肚，一顿夜宵吃美了

# 简介
# 我在广西柳州吃过很多螺蛳粉了，但是今天这家店有点不一样，它是从下午开始营业，一直到深夜。小碗的7元，大碗的8元，上面盖一层小葱酸豆角酸笋，最后浇一勺红油，仿佛给这碗螺蛳粉注入了灵魂！由于酸笋是发酵得来，很多人会觉得味道难闻，但是吃起来不错，注意不是酸臭哦，听老板讲酸臭的螺蛳粉不是好的螺蛳粉！除了常规的螺蛳粉，店家还提供一桌的卤味供顾客选择，有牛肚、猪蹄、鸡脚等！足足6大盆！那些卤味浸透汁水，看着非常有食欲！卤味+螺蛳粉，酸辣口味让人流口水！看着就超级好吃！注意⚠️晚来一会就吃不了，因为深夜都在排队！
