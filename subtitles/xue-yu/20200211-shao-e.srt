# **标题：**开车100里到郊区吃烧鹅，明火烤制256元一只，油光绽放，顾客坐满2层楼
# 简介：在广东中山吃烧鹅，这家的烧鹅在珠三角地区都很知名，烧鹅的炉子都是公开透明的，很多顾客来了就要拍照，都快要成了风景线。一只鹅一只炉子，炉子底下烧着柴火，上面的烧鹅一直在转圈圈，转足一个小时就烤好了。烧鹅看起来油光锃亮，师傅快刀斩肉，128元半只，直接上桌开吃，我能吃2碗饭。注意这家店人气火爆，虽然位置远，但是每天中午的顾客都要坐满2层楼哦。

# 一进来就看到了好多鱼

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,640
# 不过都是观赏性的鱼
9 are they bought just for decoration?

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,000
# 这是专门买的鱼吧
10 This countryside manor has everything

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,000
# 这一个农家庄园 真的是什么都有
11 Over there, is for the geese to get roasted.

# 这边呢 就是做烧鹅的

# 看我前面就是在做腐竹 还有做煎堆的
13 They have a large variety of food here.

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
# 各种各样的菜品都能在这里找得到
14 This countryside manor has 4 or 5 kitchens

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,560
# 这个农家园光厨房就有四五个
15 stir fry dish, roast goose, and pastry.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
# 炒菜 做烧鹅 做糕点
16 every chef is working on their own station.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,160
# 每个师傅好像都有自己的任务在这个地方忙
17 The thing right behind me is a few dozens of tiny ovens.

17
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
# 我后面就是几十个金钟罩
18 Right there.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
# 里面就是
19 Every each of that ovens contains a goose.

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,520
# 每一个炉子里面都有一只鹅
20 those golden-brown geese are dripping goose fat.

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,440
# 它们金黄诱人 还流着肥油
21If an ordinary goose

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,120
# 一只平平无奇的鹅
22 wants to because shinny in appearance

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
# 想要变得如此光鲜亮丽
23 It needs to go through a lot more than that.

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,520
# 还得经历一些的磨难
24 A cleaned goose has to be inflated, boiled, and blanched with cooking oil.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,720
# 洗净的鹅要吹气 滚水 烫皮
25 and then, they stuff the goose with marinates.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,520
# 然后 才能够把腌料 塞进肚子里
26 At this moment, the goose is no different expect it has been inflated.

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,920
# 这个时候的鹅 从外面看 除了变得气鼓鼓的
27 it looks like nothing has changed.

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
# 好像没有什么样的变化
28 But the aroma of the marinates are spreading all over the meat.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,600
# 但是腌料的味道 正在向全身蔓延
29 It needs to be dried,

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
# 这个鹅得先在后面进行风干处理
30 before it goes into the oven.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,840
# 然后才能够上烤炉
31 that goose is going to spin in that oven

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,520
# 它要在里面 转呀 转呀 转呀
32 for a good hour.

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,440
# 转足一个小时 才能够下来
33 In this massive manor,

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
# 在偌大的庄园里
34 spinning geese are catching all the spotlights.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,440
# 一只只烤鹅转圈圈的场景成为了全场的焦点
35 Although, we can only see the bottom part of the geese.

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
# 虽然说 我们只能看到它的下半身
36 After an hour of roasting on low heat,

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,480
# 经过长时间的文火烤制
37 The skin color of those geese is darkening.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,840
# 鹅外皮的颜色会逐渐加深
38 Also, the aroma of meat and fruit wood are thickening.

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,280
# 果木香和肉香 也变得更加浓郁
39 When geese are ready, chefs will slice the meat into this shape.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,880
# 烤鹅做好了 师傅要把它片成这种片状
40 after slicing,

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,120
# 片完之后呢
41They will pour a spoon of goose stock.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,560
# 还要在上面浇一勺的汤汁
42 It just made the goose so much tempting.

42
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,360
# 这样才能感觉到更加诱人
43 this glass is soundproofed right? I can’t hear anything.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,720
# 玻璃是隔音的吧 什么也听不到
44 but I can see that goose inside.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
# 只能看着眼馋
45 the ground level is packed, lets head to the second floor.

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
# 一楼都坐满了 我们现在要上二楼了
46 I wasn’t expecting tea here.

46
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,880
# 没想到来庄园吃饭 还要喝茶
47 I ordered some regular tea.

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,560
# 我们就是要了一个很普通的茶
48 Let’s order some food.

48
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,200
# 然后现在就是点单
49 They provide a QR code for food ordering.

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
# 它这边是扫码点单
50 Let’s see what they got.

50
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,400
# 咱们看一看有什么好吃的
51 I didn’t know they

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
# 不看不知道
52 got everything.

52
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,680
# 真的是什么都有
53 The goal of this trip is to try their roast goose.

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,080
# 咱们这次来的
目的是
吃烧鹅
54 So, I have to order that roast goose.

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
# 所以一定点
烧鹅
55 I’m getting some side dishes as well.

55
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,040
# 其它的
便点点吧
56 the goose itself looks pretty big.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,240
# 看烧鹅就挺大的了
57 What a tiny candle.

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
# 好小的蜡烛
58 they gave us candles to keep the dish warm.

58
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,280
# 给了一个加热的蜡烛
59 not bad.

59
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
# 挺好的
60 The length of the plate for this goose

60
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
# 这个放烤鹅的盘子
61 is almost

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,920
# 长度呢 差不多会有我的
62 60 centimeters.

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,720
# 四扎吧 用我的手来比划的话
63 I’m using my hand to measure it

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
# 差不多是四扎的长度
64 This is a half of the goose.

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
# 这只是半只 就是这么长
65 the skin of is shining, if I look closely,

65
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,000
# 烧鹅的外皮 油亮油亮的 仔细看
66 there is a very thin layer of fat between the mean and the skin.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,440
# 肉和皮之间还有一层很薄的脂肪层
67 Before a goose got served for eating,

67
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,880
# 一只鹅被端上餐桌之前
68 It has to be inflated, dried, roasted.

68
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,600
# 要经过吹气 风干 刷皮水 烤制等过程
69 Without the moisture in the skin,

69
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,400
# 表皮没有那么多的水分
70 it just tastes much crispier and crunchier.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,160
# 烤完之后吃起来 会有微弱的脆的口感
71 and the meat inside

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
# 而包裹在里面的鹅肉
72 will taste juicier and more tender

72
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,080
# 吃起来鲜嫩 而且多汁
73 Actually, every bite is quite fatty.

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,320
# 每一块的鹅肉 其实都是很肥腻的
74 So, you need some sweet and sour dipping sauce.

74
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,760
# 这个时候呢 你可以来点酸甜口的酱料
75 or some savory sauce.

75
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,840
# 也可以来点咸口的酱料
76 but no matter which kind of sauce you chose.

76
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,760
# 但是不管是哪种口味的
77 you can get rid of some of the greasy taste.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,840
# 对于它来说 都是解腻的
78 No matter how rich and various the food is,

78
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
# 不管菜品再丰富
79 You need a bowl of rice to finish the meal

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,400
# 最后都得归结于一碗白米饭
80 Therefore, you can get fulled

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,840
# 这样才能够感觉吃得饱
81 This goose is way to big, I couldn’t even finish a half of it

81
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
# 这个鹅实在是太大了 半只都没有吃了
82 We’re taking the goose drumstick home.

82
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,480
# 我们要把大块的鹅腿带走了
83 I almost lost track of direction on the way out.

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,120
# 走出来都差点没有找到路
84 This place is massive.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,240
# 这个地方太大了
