# 济南特色牛肉烧饼！热牛肉软烂，烧饼烫手，8元一个塞满肉能吃撑！
# Beef Shaobing in Jinan

# 简介

# “您还记得大明湖畔的夏雨荷吗”，是的，雪鱼又到了山东济南，来到济南最绕不开的美食就是牛肉烧饼！这烧饼就像西安的肉夹馍一样普遍！刚出炉的饼中间切开，把剁好的肉塞进去，满满的很厚实，拿在手里沉甸甸的感觉！一个单纯的烧饼是1.5元，夹上牛肉就是8元一个，牛肉是咸香味道，炖地软烂入味；烧饼都是从旁边炉子里直接拿出来的，很烫手，这热牛肉和热烧饼搭配一起，别提有多美啦。在济南，牛肉烧饼一般是作为早餐食用，一个就能吃饱，现在很多店铺也会营业到下午，一天都可以吃到。吃完牛肉烧饼，一定要来市区的大明湖散散步，呼吸一下新鲜空气～
