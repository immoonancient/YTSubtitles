# 听了大家的意见，搭雨棚！给师傅们做几道菜犒劳一下，以后再也不怕刮风下雨了
# After listening to everyone's opinions,we decide to build a canopy under which I will do some dishes for the workers.And we'll never be afraid of wind and rain.
# 简介
# 大家好，之前不少朋友看到露天厨房就说是不是应该搭个棚子来，的确亲身经历雨淋之后再次意识到棚子的重要性😂所以下定决心请师傅们来搭一个，户外厨房又完整了一步！在我们这边请师傅们来家里干活解决午饭问题是个传统，那理所应当下厨好好给几位做些饭菜，吃饱了饭才好干活嘛！
# Hello everyone,many friends wondered if I should build a canopy or not after seeing the outdoor kitchen before.Indeed,I realized the importance of building a canopy again after my personal experience of the rain drench.So I determined to ask the workers to build one.The outdoor kitchen is so close to complete.It is a tradition that we treat the workers lunch in our country.And it is certain that I should cook some dishes well enough for the workers so that they can work more powerful.
