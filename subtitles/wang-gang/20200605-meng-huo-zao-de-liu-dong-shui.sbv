# 厨师长解答：“猛火灶的流动水不关”，不仅仅是“浪费水”这么简单，后厨解密
# Chef explains: running water on wok burner (hint: it’s not about waste water). Restaurant kitchen demystified.

# 简介

# intro
# 大家好，因为经常看到有朋友留言说为什么“不关水龙头，感觉很浪费”，其实真的冤枉😂，虽说之前解释过多次，这次还是单独出一期视频来用实验的形式来给大家解答一下为什么专业猛火灶一定要有流水。流动水是极佳的降温材料，就像是最简单的一套水冷系统，可以让猛火灶满功率工作几个小时还不至于温度过高，来提高使用寿命。
# Hi everyone! I often see comments questioning the running water on my wok range, saying that it's a waste of resources. I feel wronged 😂. Although I have explained it many times before, I still decided to film an episode dedicated to answering this. I'll explain the purpose of running water by doing an experiment. Running water is very good for cooling. A simple water-cooling system like this can prevent the wok range from overheating even after a few hours of full power use, thus prolonging its service life.

# 哈喽大家好我是王刚
Hello, everyone. I’m Wang Gang.

0:00:02.000,0:00:03.982
# 就是我们的视频我看了一下
I had a look at our videos.

0:00:04.050,0:00:09.375
# 最近100个视频都有粉丝的弹幕在说这个水呀
Our fans have been talking about the water in danmaku comments for the last 100 episode

0:00:09.550,0:00:11.675
# 我们这个水为什么要让它流起来
Why do we keep the water flowing?

0:00:12.325,0:00:15.325
# 为什么在炒菜的时候不把它关掉呢
Why not turn it off while cooking?

0:00:15.350,0:00:17.375
# 其实今天我就跟大家解释一下
Today, I’m going to explain it.

0:00:17.675,0:00:19.075
# 其实这个炉灶的话
Actually, for this reservoir...

0:00:19.550,0:00:21.700
# 这里面的水必须要保证它是冷水
The water in here has to be cold.

0:00:21.800,0:00:25.350
# 因为我们在炒菜的时候有的时候要加冷水下锅
Because we often need to add cold water into the wok during cooking.

0:00:25.750,0:00:26.925
# 所以就不能是热水
Can’t be warm.

0:00:27.000,0:00:28.500
# 如果一旦把这个关掉
If we turn it off.

0:00:29.075,0:00:32.725
# 然后它下面的这个炉膛这里有一个洞过来
There is a hole underneath.

0:00:32.725,0:00:34.500
# 这个热气从这里出去
The heat comes out through here.

0:00:34.550,0:00:36.825
# 然后这个地方里面的水就会
Then the water in here will…

0:00:37.375,0:00:40.100
# 如果长时间没有新的冷水进来
Without cold water coming in,

0:00:40.100,0:00:41.675
# 这里面的水就会烧开
after a while, the stagnant water in here will boil.

0:00:42.000,0:00:44.225
# 我们如果想这样子洗一下手
Say we want to rinse our hands like this.

0:00:44.975,0:00:47.450
# 就肯定是不行的开水肯定是不行嘛
It won't be possible if it's boiling hot

0:00:47.950,0:00:51.175
# 然后的话就是如果我们把它关掉
If we turn this one off,

0:00:51.325,0:00:53.150
# 里面的水用完了之后
the water could run out.

0:00:54.350,0:00:57.900
# 用完了之后这个盆就是这样子 可以活动地拿出来的
It looks like this when it’s empty. It's removable.

0:00:58.100,0:01:00.275
# 这个盆的话会直接烧黑
This container could be scorched.

0:01:00.550,0:01:04.375
# 然后这边上这些高温泥它会掉
The heat resistance sealant could eventually fall apart

0:01:04.675,0:01:05.450
# 会被烧掉
Melted by the heat

0:01:05.875,0:01:11.500
# 最后就会烧到里面的一些线路老化
In the end it would damage the wires inside

0:01:11.700,0:01:13.250
# 这样子就会非常的危险
That would be very dangerous.

0:01:14.175,0:01:17.675
# 本期视频呢我就准备了一个这个
In this vide, I prepared an (experiment)

0:01:18.100,0:01:23.000
# 我就直接不开水流着就这样烧
I'll turn off the faucet, and keep the heat on.

0:01:23.075,0:01:25.475
# 烧出来给你们看一下是什么效果
And I'll show you the result.

0:01:25.575,0:01:27.700
# 第一个烧就是这里不开水
First one. Faucet off.

0:01:27.775,0:01:28.975
# 这里面是有水的
There is water inside.

0:01:29.675,0:01:31.975
# 从冷水变成开水要多久
Let's see how long it would take for this cold water to boil.

0:01:32.225,0:01:38.025
# 然后呢我就再用这个里面不放水干烧会变成什么样子
As for the other one, let's leave it empty. See what is it going to look like after heating without water.

0:01:38.525,0:01:40.950
# 首先我们把锅里面的水加满
First, we fill up the wok with water.

0:01:41.250,0:01:43.425
# 因为这个锅不可以干烧
Because it can’t be heated for too long when it’s empty.

0:01:46.875,0:01:48.975
# 然后我们把里面的水放满
Then we fill it up.

0:01:52.700,0:01:55.050
# 好啦现在我们就把这个水给关掉了
Ok. We turn it off.

0:01:55.525,0:01:56.775
# 关掉就这样烧
Let the burner run.

0:01:58.300,0:02:00.140
# 我们可以摸一下用手摸一下这里
We could touch it on the side here.

0:02:00.140,0:02:01.775
# 现在已经很烫了
It feels hot already.

0:02:02.725,0:02:07.300
# 就干烧这么大概10几秒钟下面就已经开始很烫了
It was only heated for about 10 second and the bottom has started to get very hot.

0:02:17.725,0:02:20.800
# 现在的水温在逐步增加
The water temperature is increasing gradually.

0:02:21.750,0:02:25.675
# 但是我们这边锅里面的水已经快开了
The water in the wok is about to boil.

0:02:32.450,0:02:34.500
# 好 里面的水开始慢慢热了
Ok. The water inside is getting hotter.

0:02:44.200,0:02:47.400
# 我们现在这个盆里面的（井）水大概有10℃左右了
The water (came from well) is now at around 10 °C

0:02:49.650,0:02:52.075
# 像我们经常炒菜的话
For those of us who cook a lot,

0:02:52.750,0:02:56.350
# 1个灶炒个1个小时2个小时是很正常的
It’s normal to keep the burner on for 1 to 2 hours

0:03:01.475,0:03:04.450
# 现在这个盆里面的水大概是30℃的样子
Now the water in this container is about 30°C.

0:03:11.796,0:03:13.300
# 差不多有40℃了
Almost 40°C.

0:03:14.425,0:03:16.850
# 说真的我还从来没有这样子烧过开水
Honestly, I've never tried to boil water like this.

0:03:17.595,0:03:18.481
# 因为也不敢
I didn't dare.

0:03:18.675,0:03:21.125
# 师傅看到会骂的
Master would scold me.

0:03:21.950,0:03:24.625
# 然后老板看到的话也会扣工资
And the boss would cut my pay, if he sees it.

0:03:25.600,0:03:27.175
# 这应该是我第一次这么干
It should be my first time doing this.

0:03:29.800,0:03:31.750
# 现在有一点点烫手了
Now it feels a bit too hot to touch.

0:03:41.925,0:03:44.700
# 我们这个水可能有70℃-80℃了
It's probably at 70°C-80°C.

0:03:51.925,0:03:54.951
# 这个水在慢慢的开始变浑
The water is getting cloudier

0:03:54.951,0:03:56.975
# 而且有点要开的感觉了
Seems like it's about to boil.

0:04:04.775,0:04:07.725
# 好啦现在经过我们差不多半个小时的烧
Ok. After about 30 minutes of heating,

0:04:08.350,0:04:10.550
# 这个没有放水进去现在已经变成了
Without running water, now it is...

0:04:11.350,0:04:13.425
# 几乎变成了开水
...almost boiling water.

0:04:15.150,0:04:16.900
# 用来炒菜的话是用不了的
It can’t be use for cooking.

0:04:16.975,0:04:18.200
# 有的菜我们要用冷水
We need cold water some dishes.

0:04:18.800,0:04:22.325
# 好 现在我们来把这个水给它倒出来
Ok. We pour away the water.

0:04:33.875,0:04:37.250
# 大家可以看一下干烧的时候我们这个水分已经烧干了
You could see, the remaining water boils away instantly.

0:04:37.750,0:04:39.400
# 我估计这样子来得非常快
I assume it will be scorched very soon.

0:04:39.400,0:04:44.325
# 不要5分钟这个（装水的）锅就会被烧黑
The container will be scorched within 5 minutes.

0:04:49.875,0:04:52.500
# 好 我们这个不锈钢已经变形了现在
Ok. The stainless steel has warped.

0:04:56.550,0:04:58.250
# 来 我关火给大家看一下
Ok. I'm turning off the heat to show you.

0:04:59.250,0:05:02.900
# 如果我现在放冷水进去肯定会冒出很多白烟出来
If I put cold water in it right now, there would be a lot of steam.

0:05:05.075,0:05:06.350
# 听到没这个声音
Do you hear this sound?

0:05:18.775,0:05:19.725
# 这个水已经烫了
The water is already hot.

0:05:20.175,0:05:23.475
# 也就是说我们这个里面不放水干烧的话
In other words, if we do not put water in it,

0:05:23.475,0:05:26.550
# 这个会烧黑 已经烧黑了
It will be scorched.  Already scorched.

0:05:26.750,0:05:30.750
# 这个是我们刚才故意干烧的一个结果
This is the result of our deliberate dry burning.

0:05:30.775,0:05:32.050
# 我们看一下这个
Let us take a look at this.

0:05:32.375,0:05:34.875
# 我们这个是经常放水烧的
This is the container that normally has water in.

0:05:35.800,0:05:36.550
# 对比一下
Compare them

0:05:37.050,0:05:41.700
# 这个的话如果不放水就会烧干烧焦
This one, if we do not put water in, it will be scorched.

0:05:42.000,0:05:48.425
# 正规厨房来说的话这个地方它是一个流动水
In a standard kitchen, this one is for running water.

0:05:48.550,0:05:49.700
# 然后在这个地方
Then at this place

0:05:50.075,0:05:52.250
# 这里我们不动它
We do not move it.

0:05:52.275,0:05:53.100
# 就感觉这里
Use this one only.

0:05:54.700,0:05:55.975
# 这里还会放一个盆
There will be another container here.

0:05:56.825,0:05:59.550
# 我们这里面的水是用来洗锅用的
The water in here is for rinsing the wok.

0:05:59.550,0:06:01.525
# 这里面的水是用来炒菜用的
The water in here is for cooking.

0:06:01.975,0:06:06.350
# 所以我们这个会一直把它开起来
So we always keep it on

0:06:06.450,0:06:08.000
# 作为一个流动水
so that we have water running

0:06:11.975,0:06:14.100
# 好啦今天的实验就到这里
OK. The experiment is done.

0:06:14.400,0:06:16.300
# 今天浪费了一大半瓶煤气
We wasted more than a half of cylinder of methane

0:06:17.000,0:06:20.000
# 通过这个实验我们得出来了一个结论
Through the experiment, we can draw a conclusion.

0:06:20.075,0:06:25.150
# 就是这个必须开水一直给它流动起来
It is that we have to turn on the faucet and keep the water running.

0:06:25.500,0:06:27.900
# 不然这里面的水会变得非常烫
Otherwise, the water inside can get very hot.

0:06:28.450,0:06:30.525
# 就是说我们炒菜嘛用不上
That means we can’t use it for cooking.

0:06:31.600,0:06:34.700
# 然后我们这个盆里面必须要有足够的水
There has to be enough water in the container.

0:06:34.800,0:06:37.125
# 如果没有水的话会把这个烧坏
If left empty, it will be scorched.

0:06:37.425,0:06:41.000
# 把这一片温度过高烧坏了之后
Once this area becomes damaged from overheating,

0:06:41.975,0:06:43.700
# 里面的高温泥会掉
The heat resistance sealant inside would fall apart

0:06:43.875,0:06:46.250
# 掉了之后的话这个边也会掉
After that, this side here will be burnt out too.

0:06:46.450,0:06:47.950
# 慢慢的这个灶就会塌
This range will collapse.

0:06:48.225,0:06:50.825
# 所以的话我们必须放水
So we have to keep the water running.

0:06:51.650,0:06:54.050
# 以后大家就不要再说浪费这个事情了
Hopefully you'll stop commenting about me 'wasting water'.

0:06:54.250,0:06:55.625
# 好啦 本期视频到这里
Ok. That's it for this video.

0:06:55.875,0:06:56.400
# 拜拜
Bye!
