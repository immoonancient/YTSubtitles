大家好 今天兄弟带我过来抓这个蝗虫
Hello everyone, today my bro takes me here to catch some locusts

这个蝗虫是可以吃的
The "grasshopper" thingy is actually edible 

你看，他在这儿吃皇竹草
You can see it gnawing at the Giant Nipier
# uncertain if i should do 0 translation

哎哟
Ayo

你看，兄弟说这种颜色的，这种颜色的可以吃的哦
Look, my bro told me that locusts of this color are edible

其他颜色的最好就不要吃，不知道有没有毒
Don't eat those of other colors, not sure if those kinds are safe

这个是没毒的，可以吃的
This is nontoxic,pretty much edible

嘿，想飞，飞得起来吗
Hey! Wanna fly? How dare ya~

我在这里还飞
Im here and you will not fly

这里还有一个抓到了，抓了两个
I captured another one here, got two of them

哇，这好几只哦
Aw, a buch of them here

还有一个会飞的
One even can fly

跑了
Escaped...

算他运气好
It's lucky

抓了几个了，前面看看有没有
I've got a couple already, let's move forward to see if there are any over there

哇，这儿有一个
Aw, one here!

想跑
No escape!

就抓了那么一点点
We only got a small fraction of them

我们用水泡一下
Let's dunk it in the water

来，放在水里面泡一下，把他们通通泡死
Submerge the basket into the water, drown them all!

淹死他们
Sink them

嗯嗯 动不了了吧
Hehe XD now you won't move anymore

你看，这样压下去
Look, press it downward like this

等会再过来
Wait a little while and we'll be back

等个十分钟他们就全部死了
Just in ten min. or so they will be all dead

（20分钟后）
(Twenty min. later)

我把这个蝗虫清理一下
Let me rinse the locusts a little bit

你看 全部死了
You can see they are all dead

哇 你看，一放下去马上就炸熟了
Wow, look, it's well done immedately after the drop

等下把它捞起来
Wait a sec. to scoop it out

应该快熟了
It should be almost done

感觉变得好大条哦
Feeling like they get larger

一油炸它，他好像就 他好像就长大了，长大了一点一样
It looks like been expanding for a little bit post-frying

这火候不够哦，加一点
It's undercooked, add some more

等下没熟 等下没熟的话就不好办了
It would be bad if it's undercooked

这里才煎了三分之一
I only fried one third of them

这煎不了那么多
This wok won't make that much

油不够
Oil will be insuffcient 

哇，好烫
Ayo it's burning hot

都不知道蝗虫知不知道
I dunno if locusts know'bout that

这个油好烫啊
The oil is scalding

加点盐
Sprinkle some salt...

尝一个

嗯，好吃
humm, it tastes good

这个挺好吃的
This dish is pretty delicious

嗯，它像那个虾的味道一样
Emm, it tastes similar to the shrimp

你看，刚刚还活蹦乱跳的，现在就
You see, it used to be alive and kicking, but now...

变成嘴巴上的肉了
...now it's at my fingertips

真的不错哦
Really not bad~

下次要叫兄弟 多抓点
Next time gonna let my bro catch some more
